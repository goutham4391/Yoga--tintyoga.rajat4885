Nowadays, <strong>hip hop is deeply ingrained into our modern culture<\/strong>, having inspired fashion, art and people. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article gives you a quick look into hip hop history, a brief overview of health benefits associated with hip hop dancing, what you need to know about combining hip hop and yoga, and of course, you will find the right <strong>hip hop yoga playlist<\/strong> for you. Stay tuned for one of TINT&#8217;s Instructors and their very own playlist for hip hop and yoga. In order to get to know the genre better, let\u2019s first take a look at hip hop history.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"1\">1. Hip Hop History<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2\">1.1. Old School Hip Hop<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The roots of hip hop are often associated with the South Bronx in New York City in the late 1970s. <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/1awRDNgMqiX2eSoUmdejNs?highlight=spotify:track:3J1urjN1cwbyZ8fO111YYK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DJ Kool Herc<\/a>, aka Clive Campbell, who was only 18 at the time, is often seen as <strong>the first Hip Hop DJ<\/strong>. A native Jamaican, he was the first to introduce two turntables when Deejaying on August 11, 1973, combining older tracks and newer beats to &#8220;create a continuous flow of music&#8221;.

Grandmaster Flash are associated with the term hip hop \u2013 apparently, they felt the term fit the rhythm of soldiers marching to war. This term was picked up in the song &#8220;Rapper&#8217;s Delight&#8221; by <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/5U8uBbrvuecWKL1xNmulLL?highlight=spotify:track:0RxphrRef802DdWKfTZiVG\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the Sugarhill Gang<\/a>, which was written in 1979 and is considered the first significant hip hop song.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3\">1.2. New School Hip Hop<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From the mid-1980s on, a new era of hip hop began. Hip hop artists of the time include <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3CQIn7N5CuRDP8wEI7FiDA?autoplay=true\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">RUN-D.M.C.<\/a> (you might know their song &#8220;It&#8217;s like that&#8221;), <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1P8IfcNKwrkQP5xJWuhaOC?autoplay=true\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LL Cool J<\/a>, the <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/03r4iKL2g2442PT9n2UKsx?autoplay=true\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Beastie Boys<\/a> \u2013 who introduced digital sampling, a style of producing music that combines a song with music and sounds extracted from existing songs \u2013 and <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6Mo9PoU6svvhgEum7wh2Nd?autoplay=true\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Public Enemy<\/a>, who brought <strong>political ideologies<\/strong> into the genre. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, a number of <strong>female rappers<\/strong> emerged, as well, namely <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/5m7wCUhYhBh7A3A3YMxrbt?autoplay=true\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Queen Latifah<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/7wqtxqI3eo7Gn1P7SpP6cQ?autoplay=true\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Salt-n-Pepa<\/a>. Just like <a href=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/magazine\/female-warriors-the-empowerment-of-women-through-yoga\/\">yoga empowers women<\/a>, these female hip hop artists proved that the genre isn&#8217;t just for a part of the population. <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4EnEZVjo3w1cwcQYePccay?autoplay=true\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">N.W.A.<\/a>&#8216;s 1989 album Straight Outta Compton changed hip hop up again, with their band members <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3Mcii5XWf6E0lrY3Uky4cA?autoplay=true\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ice Cube<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/7B4hKK0S9QYnaoqa9OuwgX?autoplay=true\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eazy E<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7?autoplay=true\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dr. Dre<\/a> becoming famous in their own right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"quote-wrapper\">\n<p class=\"quote\">&#8220;Hip Hop started out in the heart.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"quote-author\">\u2013 Lauryn Hill.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4\">1.3.

Other genres, such as R&amp;B and Gospel, had also become influenced by hip hop at the time, with artists such as <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1XkoF8ryArs86LZvFOkbyr?autoplay=true\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mary J.

Elements of Hip Hop<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The elements of hip hop, which are also called the 5 pillars of hip hop, describe <strong>the elements of hip hop culture<\/strong>. While four elements of hip hop are agreed upon by most people in the hip hop community, one remains an object of discussion among fans of the genre. The agreed-upon 4 elements of hip hop are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"7\">2.1. Deejaying<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This art form combines different songs and different kinds of music in an artistic manner. Deejaying is also called &#8220;turntabling&#8221;. Being a Disk Jockey isn&#8217;t easy \u2013 you have to know a lot about music, how it influences the mood and energy in a room, and how to combine different songs in a harmonic way. According to <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http:\/\/djrelease.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DJ Release<\/a>, Alexander Laios, who has been producing music for many years, &#8220;music awakens your emotions&#8221;. Even more interestingly, <strong>the same music can awaken different emotions in different people<\/strong> &#8211; enabling everyone listening to a song to &#8220;escape into their own private world and their own emotions&#8221;. These emotions then help you move to a beat \u2013 expressing your inner world externally through dance, sports or yoga.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"8\">2.2. Rapping<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This art form uses speech in a rhythmic manner, often expressing personal opinions or discontent at a situation. Famous rap artists include Eminem, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg and <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/0hCNtLu0JehylgoiP8L4Gh?autoplay=true\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nicki Minaj<\/a>. One of the benefits of hip hop music is that you can find your own rhythm, and can create your own style of the genre. That is similar to <a href=\"https:\/\/watch.tintyoga.com\/categories\/inside-flow\">Inside Flow<\/a>, Young Ho Kim&#8217;s yoga style that is based on Vinyasa yoga. Here, &#8220;Storytelling&#8221; is one of the most important pillars of the style. Choosing a song close to your heart and telling your students about it can be just as exposing as rapping about your feelings. But just like in hip hop, being <strong>\u201cbrave, open and authentic\u201d<\/strong> is important in life and Inside Flow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- IMAGE 16:9 -->\n<div class=\"image-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"aspectratio\" data-ratio=\"16:9\" position=\"bottom\">\n  <div>\n   <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/TINT_Magazine_YHK_Academy.jpg\">\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<!-- CAPTION -->\n<p class=\"caption\">Be brave, open and authentic \u2013 take your chance and become an <a href=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/inside-flow-academy\/\">Inside Flow Teacher<\/a>, on TINT.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"9\">2.3. Graffiti<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>More than just words on a wall painted by a spray can, <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/urbanario.es\/en\/articulo\/graffiti-or-street-art-julio-204-and-daniel-buren-in-1968\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">graffiti has existed on its own since 1968<\/a>.The concept is often based on &#8220;identity and repetition&#8221; and differentiates itself form <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/banksy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">street art<\/a> in that &#8220;pedestrians are not invited to participate&#8221;. Often, graffiti is used as a form of advertising \u2013 for street gangs, for a particular person, for products. Other times, it is used to express an opinion (often political), and sometimes, just to have some fun with words. While <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/urbanario.es\/en\/articulo\/what-does-graffiti-have-to-do-with-hip-hop\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">graffiti is linked intrinsically to hip hop<\/a>, it actually came first. It&#8217;s <strong>the perfect tool for people to express themselves<\/strong>, especially when they may not be heard otherwise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"10\">2.4. Break Dancing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>More than just dancing, <strong>break dancing incorporates hip-hop dance, style, attitude and body language<\/strong>. We don&#8217;t exactly know who created the hip hop dance called break dancing, or how hip hop dancing started. What we do know, however, is that break dancing is open to many different types of people of all body types, genders and age groups due to its freestyle nature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fifth element of hip hop, <strong>knowledge of self<\/strong>, is usually cited by scholars alongside fashion and language, but usually, only the first four elements of hip hop are easily agreed upon by fans of the genre. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you&#8217;re wondering <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smartrapper.com\/write-a-rap-song\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">how to compose a hip hop song<\/a>, that&#8217;s not our forte here at TINT. But we <em>can<\/em> help you with <a href=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/magazine\/yoga-class-sequence-free-sample-sequences\/\">creating your own yoga class sequences<\/a>! You can get as creative as you like, and make your yoga class your own, just like you would a song. <\/p>\n\n\n<span style=\"--tl-form-height-m:1213.05px;--tl-form-height-t:638.781px;--tl-form-height-d:638.781px;\" class=\"tl-placeholder-f-type-shortcode_158494 tl-preload-form\"><span><\/span><\/span>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"11\">3. Hip Hop Yoga Class: How Does That Work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoga is usually associated with instrumental music and spiritual music (mantra music, yoga chants). Other genres, such as heavy metal and hip hop, aren&#8217;t commonly linked to yoga, which is why it&#8217;s great that today, (almost) all genres of music work with your yoga practice! For Young Ho Kim, founder of Inside Flow, <strong>the most important part of music for your yoga practice<\/strong> is that the music &#8220;touches your soul&#8221; and that it helps you stay &#8220;authentic&#8221;. If you want to know more about the topic, you can read more on the <a href=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/magazine\/why-music-is-important\/\">theory of music during yoga<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/magazine\/do-yoga-and-music-work\/\">combination of yoga and music<\/a> in our TINT Magazine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great thing about hip hop? The health benefits. Read on to know more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"12\">3.1. What Are the Health Benefits of Hip Hop Dancing?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The history of hip hop and the five elements of hip hop are highly interesting. But you may be wondering: How can hip hop dance classes make me healthy? <strong>Dancing, which includes hip hop dancing, has a number of health benefits<\/strong>: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>When moving, your heart rate rises, which is great for your cardiovascular health and overall fitness. <\/li><li>Hip hop dance moves are also great for toning your muscles, especially in the arms, legs and core, and thus promoting the health of your bones and joints. <\/li><li>While physical health is important for your <strong>health and happiness<\/strong>, so is mental health. Exercise of any kind helps reduce stress and anxiety.<\/li><li>Moving to music further helps you improve your muscle memory \u2013 which can help you stay fit for many years, and helps regain your strength more easily when not working out enough in stressful times.<\/li><li> It&#8217;s also just nice to move more easily throughout the day, feeling lighter on your feet and more relaxed.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to improve the functionality of your body even further, or if you&#8217;re wondering <strong>how to get better at hip hop<\/strong>, the <a href=\"https:\/\/watch.tintyoga.com\/programs\/functional-body\">Functional Body<\/a> Workshop by <a href=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/instructors\/alexey-gaevskij\/\">Alexey Gaevskij<\/a> gives you targeted exercises for the <a href=\"https:\/\/watch.tintyoga.com\/programs\/functional-body?cid=1154738\">core<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/watch.tintyoga.com\/programs\/functional-body?cid=1154736\">knees<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/watch.tintyoga.com\/programs\/functional-body?cid=1154721\">wrists<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And if you just want to move to a beat<\/strong> \u2013 take a look at our Inside Flow classes, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/watch.tintyoga.com\/programs\/inside-flow-stand-alone\">Alexey Gaevskij\u2019s Stand Alone<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/watch.tintyoga.com\/programs\/inside-flow-run-for-your-life\">Young Ho Kim\u2019s Run for your Life<\/a> or our <a href=\"https:\/\/watch.tintyoga.com\/programs\/inside-flow-pillow-talk\">Inside Flow Pillow Talk<\/a>.
