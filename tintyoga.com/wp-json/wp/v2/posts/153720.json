Introduction \u2013 What Is TINT?<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>TINT Yoga is an online education and coaching platform for ambitious yogis, yoga lovers, and yoga teachers. However, we are not a usual yoga platform. We question traditional yoga. We embrace evolution and have the courage to be different. We want to lead by positive example and encourage you to do the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to find out more about our vision, mission and offers. But let\u2019s start with some basic facts about TINT.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1.1. Bringing Meaning Into Our Logo&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Acronym TINT<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our logo is composed of two elements: first TINT, the name of the company. This acronym stands for \u201cThere is no try\u201d. This is an attitude related to doing things with passion, awareness and without excuse or exception. Don\u2019t just <em>try<\/em>. <em>Do<\/em>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not a secret that we only live once. But have you ever really thought about what this means? Everything you do has an impact. And every second of your life, you have the opportunity to have an impact. Do or do not. There is no in between. Always do what\u2019s in your power and put all your heart into it. Don\u2019t let limits hold you back. Don\u2019t overthink, take action instead. Don\u2019t let the world hold you back. Trust in yourself and do. That\u2019s the reason why we don\u2019t offer a free trial. We encourage you to go all in and commit wholeheartedly to your personal growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The G\u00f6mb\u00f6c<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The second element is the so-called <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/G%C3%B6mb%C3%B6c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">G\u00f6mb\u00f6c<\/a>. This is a convex three-dimensional homogeneous body that, when resting on a flat surface, has just one stable and one unstable point of equilibrium. As such, it is a symbol for stability and balance. It is an object that can return to an equilibrium point regardless of the position in which it is placed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider this a metaphor for your own behavior: Don\u2019t let the circumstances around you throw you out of balance. When you know your purpose, your values, and your goals, you will always find your true north and stay on the straight and narrow.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- IMAGE 16:9 -->\n<div class=\"image-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"individual\">\n  <div>\n   <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/logo_color_black.png\" width=\"500\">\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<!-- CAPTION -->\n<p class=\"caption\">Our logo: TINT and the G\u00f6mb\u00f6c.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>1.2. Our 4 Pillars: Knowledge, Personality, Inspiration, Success<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to be more than just an online yoga provider for you. We give you the tools you need to find happiness and fulfillment. We base our offerings on these 4 pillars:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Knowledge&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All our contents are based on the most recent findings in anatomy and physiology and are presented by highly skilled instructors with many years of experience. Most of them are pioneers in their special field and have already inspired thousands of students and aspiring yoga teachers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Personality&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We provide you with all the tools and knowledge you need to grow not only your physical strength but also to work on your mental strengths to become the person you want to be.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Inspiration&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Get inspired by valuable input from our instructors, who can draw upon their many years of experience as teachers of teachers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Success<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We help you find and execute the right strategy to live the life you\u2019ve always dreamed of. Maybe you want to bring more awareness into your life or take your yoga practice to the next level. Maybe you want to work on your mental strength. Or you even aspire to become a yoga teacher yourself. No matter what it is, we want to give you the tools you need to fulfill your dreams.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- IMAGE 16:9 -->\n<div class=\"image-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"individual\">\n  <div>\n   <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/TINT-Topic-Circle-Reduced.webp\">\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<!-- CAPTION -->\n<p class=\"caption\">Our 4 pillars: knowledge, personality, inspiration, success.<\/i><\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2\">2. Our Vision \u2013 Why We Founded TINT<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We are passionate about helping people to achieve personal fulfillment to find happiness. We truly believe that we are responsible for our happiness and can take action to induce change. Yoga is a great tool to achieve fulfillment as it deeply connects body and mind in a way no other movement form does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 200 million people practice yoga worldwide \u2013 and due to recent global developments, online yoga has gained increasing public awareness and is practiced more and more frequently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is predominantly a good thing as it makes yoga accessible to people who do not have an (affordable) yoga studio close to them or cannot find their favorite style of yoga or yoga teacher nearby.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, yoga is more than just a trend and a good stretch. When practiced correctly, it is a great tool to work on your mobility, flexibility, and stability. It also helps you to improve your body awareness and body intelligence.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, yoga is also a mental practice, helping you to develop a healthier mindset, train your resilience, and practice mindfulness, which will organically translate into your life off the mat.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like no other movement form, yoga is a holistic body-and-mind practice that has many benefits for your physical and mental health.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if practiced incorrectly \u2013 maybe due to an insufficiently trained teacher \u2013 you can also harm your body. Especially inexperienced yoga practitioners tend to overestimate the limits of their bodies (or haven\u2019t detected them yet!) and push themselves harder into poses than would do them good. And all that because they received inadequate guidance from an (online) yoga teacher or because they tried to equal the oh so gorgeous yoga teachers on Social Media.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the vast offer of online yoga classes, it\u2019s difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff, i.e. to find high-quality content that is healthy, safe, and efficient.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where TINT comes into play: It is our passion to support people to find personal fulfillment and success. This is only possible with a strong commitment. And that\u2019s what our brand name stands for: TINT \u2013 there is no try.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, we partner with highly skilled professionals with years of experience as yoga teachers and teachers of teachers in order to ensure a safe and efficient online yoga practice.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to support you on your journey to personal fulfillment and success. We see ourselves as a true partner and coach. We are more than just an online yoga platform with on-demand yoga video content. We want you to grow, develop, and achieve your goals. Our offers are aimed at ambitious yoga lovers and yoga teachers, who are willing to face change and growth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, we are not for beginners. We are for ambitious yoga lovers and yoga teachers who live these values to the fullest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"3\">3. Our Mission \u2013 How We Want to Support You<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"quote-wrapper\">\n<p class=\"quote\">&#8220;We enable ambitious yoga lovers to achieve personal fulfillment and success no matter where you are. We act as a true partner and coach on your journey to sustainable growth while creating lasting memories along your way. We don\u2019t try. We stand out. We do. There is no try.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"quote-author\">\u2013 TINT.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>We are more than just a content provider. We help and support you by giving you the tools you need. We deliver knowledge, inspiration, and feedback. We make things possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.1. For Ambitious Yoga Lovers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast to other online yoga providers, we focus on committed yoga practitioners who want to evolve and thrive and are constantly seeking to improve their knowledge and skills. If you want to live your passion for yoga and are convinced that yoga is a powerful tool to better understand the body and mind, you\u2019ve come to the right place.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this means that we are not for beginners. On the one hand, because beginners are in the safest possible hands in an in-person class with an experienced yoga teacher who can actually touch and adjust them adequately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, we believe that at least some basic knowledge and experience is required in order to move further. You need a solid foundation to build your dream house. The same goes for yoga (or any other practice).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.2. Achieve Personal Fulfillment and Success<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>TINT is the place to live your passion: If your purpose of life is to bring joy and happiness to others, then yoga is a great vehicle to achieve this. Like no other movement practice, yoga combines physical and mental practices, making it a holistic approach to a healthier body and mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from that, if you are or want to become a yoga teacher, this practice is a great way to have an impact on other people\u2019s lives and receive recognition by supporting others to thrive. You will feel valued, receive appreciation and appreciate yourself on a deeper level. Yoga can help you become the person you want to be and we want to support you with this as best as we can.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you\u2019ve always dreamed of earning a living with yoga, we help you find and execute the right strategy to achieve exactly this. We provide you the tools and knowledge, and boost your self-esteem and courage so that you can stand out and live to your full potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.3. Your True Partner and Coach \u2013 Wherever You Are<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to be more for you than just an online yoga platform. We believe in mutual long-term commitment that is based on a relationship of trust. Our commitment towards you: We are there for you. We listen to your needs, fears, and doubts. We motivate and inspire you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your commitment towards us: Your whole heart, passion, and sincerity. That\u2019s the reason why we don\u2019t offer a free trial period (remember: There is no try.). We don\u2019t want to entice you with seductive promotion offers or huge no-brainer discounts. We want you to make a conscious decision to invest energy, time and \u2013 yes \u2013 also money in yourself.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But don\u2019t worry: Should you find out that TINT really isn\u2019t for you (what we don\u2019t hope but \u2013 hey \u2013 you can\u2019t be everybody\u2019s darling), we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. You can simply send a message to our <a href=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/help\">Support Team<\/a> (who, by the way, is always willing to help you with any other issues as well!) and we will refund the money. No questions asked. Promised. Just make sure it\u2019s within the 30 days from your subscription date.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also believe in growth through honest and constructive feedback \u2013 on both sides. That\u2019s why we have implemented a <a href=\"https:\/\/feedback.tintyoga.com\/\">Feedback Portal<\/a> where you can tell us what you need, what you don\u2019t like, and what your pain points are.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also want to make high-quality yoga content and education accessible to everybody and every body. We want to offer you an easily accessible and flexible learning and training experience where place and time no longer are a restriction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With TINT, you can enjoy exclusive yoga and inspirational content and connect with like-minded people \u2013 irrespective of your current personal living conditions. That makes online yoga such a powerful tool nowadays. And with our smartphone and smartTV apps, you can even access TINT on the go and download your favorite contents to use in times where you don\u2019t have an internet connection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.4. Your Journey to Sustainable Growth<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>TINT is the place for people who are ready to face the challenges of a real journey towards success and fulfillment. Single events won\u2019t make a change. The road to happiness is not straight. It\u2019s a roller-coaster. We are at your side through all the ups and downs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sustainable growth means repeatable and healthy development that is responsible to, and for, current and future communities. It\u2019s the key to long-term success, happiness and fulfilment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe in healthy and lasting improvements and want to help you produce long-term effects. This is why our minimum membership is 3 months. It took, for example, 29 years until <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alexander_Graham_Bell\">Alexander Graham Bell<\/a> invented the telephone and he filed more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.history.com\/news\/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-alexander-graham-bell\">600 lawsuits<\/a> over his telephone patent. Growth won\u2019t happen overnight. With this minimum commitment, you lay the foundation for your long-term growth and development.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"4\">4. Our Offer \u2013 What We Do for You<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Our offer comprises two main products: our TINT Membership with new content every day, including single classes to practice, series to learn and increase your knowledge, and inspirational videos.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part is our TINT Academy with certified yoga teacher trainings, varying from full 200-hour yoga teacher trainings to Inside Flow teacher trainings and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, our contents are easily accessible since you can watch them online via your browser, or use our smartphone and smartTV apps where you can even download your favorite content pieces and watch them without an Internet connection.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The global yoga market is huge but we are committed to a clear vision and direction and, thus, found our niche. We are ready to revolutionize yoga training and education with a modern approach and a holistic content strategy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.1.

Introduction \u2013 What Is TINT?<\/h1>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>TINT Yoga is an online education and coaching platform for ambitious yogis, yoga lovers, and yoga teachers. However, we are not a usual yoga platform. We question traditional yoga. We embrace evolution and have the courage to be different. We want to lead by positive example and encourage you to do the same.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Read on to find out more about our vision, mission and offers.

Bringing Meaning Into Our Logo&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>The Acronym TINT<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our logo is composed of two elements: first TINT, the name of the company. This acronym stands for \u201cThere is no try\u201d. This is an attitude related to doing things with passion, awareness and without excuse or exception. Don\u2019t just <em>try<\/em>. <em>Do<\/em>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It\u2019s not a secret that we only live once. But have you ever really thought about what this means? Everything you do has an impact. And every second of your life, you have the opportunity to have an impact. Do or do not. There is no in between. Always do what\u2019s in your power and put all your heart into it. Don\u2019t let limits hold you back. Don\u2019t overthink, take action instead. Don\u2019t let the world hold you back. Trust in yourself and do. That\u2019s the reason why we don\u2019t offer a free trial. We encourage you to go all in and commit wholeheartedly to your personal growth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>The G\u00f6mb\u00f6c<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The second element is the so-called <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/G%C3%B6mb%C3%B6c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">G\u00f6mb\u00f6c<\/a>.

Our Vision \u2013 Why We Founded TINT<\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We are passionate about helping people to achieve personal fulfillment to find happiness. We truly believe that we are responsible for our happiness and can take action to induce change. Yoga is a great tool to achieve fulfillment as it deeply connects body and mind in a way no other movement form does.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>More than 200 million people practice yoga worldwide \u2013 and due to recent global developments, online yoga has gained increasing public awareness and is practiced more and more frequently.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is predominantly a good thing as it makes yoga accessible to people who do not have an (affordable) yoga studio close to them or cannot find their favorite style of yoga or yoga teacher nearby.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, yoga is more than just a trend and a good stretch. When practiced correctly, it is a great tool to work on your mobility, flexibility, and stability. It also helps you to improve your body awareness and body intelligence.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Furthermore, yoga is also a mental practice, helping you to develop a healthier mindset, train your resilience, and practice mindfulness, which will organically translate into your life off the mat.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like no other movement form, yoga is a holistic body-and-mind practice that has many benefits for your physical and mental health.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, if practiced incorrectly \u2013 maybe due to an insufficiently trained teacher \u2013 you can also harm your body. Especially inexperienced yoga practitioners tend to overestimate the limits of their bodies (or haven\u2019t detected them yet!) and push themselves harder into poses than would do them good. And all that because they received inadequate guidance from an (online) yoga teacher or because they tried to equal the oh so gorgeous yoga teachers on Social Media.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With the vast offer of online yoga classes, it\u2019s difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff, i.e. to find high-quality content that is healthy, safe, and efficient.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is where TINT comes into play: It is our passion to support people to find personal fulfillment and success. This is only possible with a strong commitment.

For Ambitious Yoga Lovers<\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In contrast to other online yoga providers, we focus on committed yoga practitioners who want to evolve and thrive and are constantly seeking to improve their knowledge and skills. If you want to live your passion for yoga and are convinced that yoga is a powerful tool to better understand the body and mind, you\u2019ve come to the right place.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yes, this means that we are not for beginners. On the one hand, because beginners are in the safest possible hands in an in-person class with an experienced yoga teacher who can actually touch and adjust them adequately.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the other hand, we believe that at least some basic knowledge and experience is required in order to move further. You need a solid foundation to build your dream house. The same goes for yoga (or any other practice).<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>3.2. Achieve Personal Fulfillment and Success<\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>TINT is the place to live your passion: If your purpose of life is to bring joy and happiness to others, then yoga is a great vehicle to achieve this. Like no other movement practice, yoga combines physical and mental practices, making it a holistic approach to a healthier body and mind.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Apart from that, if you are or want to become a yoga teacher, this practice is a great way to have an impact on other people\u2019s lives and receive recognition by supporting others to thrive.

Yoga can help you become the person you want to be and we want to support you with this as best as we can.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And if you\u2019ve always dreamed of earning a living with yoga, we help you find and execute the right strategy to achieve exactly this.

Just make sure it\u2019s within the 30 days from your subscription date.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We also believe in growth through honest and constructive feedback \u2013 on both sides. That\u2019s why we have implemented a <a href=\"https:\/\/feedback.tintyoga.com\/\">Feedback Portal<\/a> where you can tell us what you need, what you don\u2019t like, and what your pain points are.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We also want to make high-quality yoga content and education accessible to everybody and every body.
