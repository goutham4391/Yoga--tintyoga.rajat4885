But how beneficial is this iconic yoga pose really?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoga has been around for almost tens of centuries, and it has its roots deeply <strong>situated within the Indian Subcontinent<\/strong>. Thanks to urbanization and the internet age, people in the West have gotten to know this meaningful practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broadly, yoga has different forms and postures that focus on different outcomes for the human body. Still, this article is about the yoga pose <em>Padmasana<\/em> and its benefits for our bodies. Before you get to know the benefits of this asana, you should know what exactly it is and how to practice it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"toc-wrapper\">\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at Padamasa in more detail:<\/p>\n\n<ul class=\"fa-ul toc-list\">\n  <li>\n  <span class=\"fa-li\"><i class=\"fa fa-long-arrow-right\"><\/i><\/span>\n  <a href=\"#1\">1.

How To Get Into Lotus Pose (Padmasana)?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To know what <em>Padmasana<\/em> is, we would like to decode what it means in English. <em>Padma<\/em> means Lotus in Sanskrit, and <em>asana<\/em> means position or posture. So basically, <em>Padmasana<\/em> means Lotus Posture. And this cross-legged <a href=\"https:\/\/magazine.tintyoga.com\/meditation-sitting-position\">sitting position<\/a> is one of the most recognized poses used for <a href=\"https:\/\/magazine.tintyoga.com\/yoga-meditation-a-practice-of-mindfulness\/\">yoga meditation<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- IMAGE 16:9 -->\n<div class=\"image-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"individual\">\n  <div>\n  <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/tint_magazine_lotus-pose_padmasana_cris-su.jpeg\">\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<!-- CAPTION -->\n<p class=\"caption\">Padmasana or Lotus Pose is one of the most recognized mediation sitting positions. <i>Photo: TINT Instructor <a href=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/instructors\/chris-su\/\">Chris Su<\/a><\/i>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to getting into the <em>Padmasana<\/em> posture at home by yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Lay down a mat on the floor, and sit on it with your legs stretched out. At the same time, keep your spine erect (almost at a 90-degree angle).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Bend your right leg and gently place it onto your left thigh. Now ensure that the heel of your left foot is pointing inwards towards your abdomen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Similarly, repeat the above step for your left leg and make sure that the heel of that foot also points towards your abdomen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Now that you have both of your legs crossed in the perfect position place your hands on your knees. Bring the thumb and the index finger to touch before placing your hands on your knees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Keep your head high and spine straight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. Keep holding the posture with long yet swift breaths, both on the inside and the outside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular yoga practice along with <a href=\"https:\/\/magazine.tintyoga.com\/pranayama-an-intro-to-the-power-of-yogic-breathing\/\">Pranayama<\/a> and meditation practice to <a href=\"https:\/\/magazine.tintyoga.com\/quietening-our-thougths-through-meditation\/\">quieten your thoughts<\/a> might relax you from your hectic work routine.<\/p>\n\n\n<span style=\"--tl-form-height-m:1213.05px;--tl-form-height-t:638.781px;--tl-form-height-d:638.781px;\" class=\"tl-placeholder-f-type-shortcode_158494 tl-preload-form\"><span><\/span><\/span>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2\">2. What are the Benefits of Padmasana?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from relaxing, the Lotus yoga pose has many more benefits. Let\u2019s explore some of them below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.1. Better Concentration<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Suppose you are looking to increase your<strong> concentration power and ability to focus<\/strong> on general things around you. In that case, you should opt for <em>Padmasana<\/em> pose. It increases the concentration power of the brain by calming the nerves and helping them to focus better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.2. Beneficial For Females<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As per the <em>Vedas<\/em>, ancient Indian books, this asana helps females preserve their natural fluids inside the body, <strong>preventing abdominal diseases<\/strong>. It uses <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5433118\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">specific acupuncture meridian<\/a> energies to carry out the healing process effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.3. Improves Mental Health Significantly<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lasting tranquility and calmness<\/strong> make way into the mind and body when one performs this asana. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3193654\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Mississippi University suggests<\/a> that Yoga provides an edge over mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, and chronic or acute stress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per their research paper, yoga poses such as <em>Padmasana<\/em> help <strong>relax the body and slow down breathing<\/strong>. Also, this posture helps slow down the heart rate and de-inflates the blood pressure to optimum levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary purpose of Lotus pose in yoga is to create <strong>a lasting feeling of \u2018well-being\u2019<\/strong> and generate an energy that boosts the immune system for efficient functioning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.4. Increases Hemoglobin Count In Blood<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Padmasana<\/em> might also be an aid in increasing the hemoglobin and red blood cells in the blood fluid, ultimately adding up to <strong>better oxygen infusion<\/strong> in the body cells and enhanced functionality of the overall body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.5. Might be Beneficial for Pregnant Ladies<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Ayurvedic texts suggest that the <em>Padmasana<\/em> yoga pose might be beneficial for pregnant ladies as it might help them <strong>ease their labor pain<\/strong> during childbirth. This asana has also been known to relieve menstrual discomfort in women of all ages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- IMAGE 16:9 -->\n<div class=\"image-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"individual\">\n  <div>\n  <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/tint_magazine_lotus-pose_padmasana_yongsubi.jpeg\">\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<!-- CAPTION -->\n<p class=\"caption\">The yoga pose Padmasana has many benefits and improves well-being. <i>Photo by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/accounts\/login\/\">Youngsubi<\/a><\/i>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3\">3. Which Points to Consider Before Performing Padmasana (Lotus Pose)?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t know how to get in the Lotus position all by yourself, or you don\u2019t have a mentor, consider these pointers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, it might be problematic for you to get in the <em>Padmasana<\/em> position because you are not in practice. In such situations, you should <strong>start with <em>Ardha Padmasana<\/em> posture<\/strong>. If we translate the name from Sanskrit, it means Half Lotus yoga pose. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of placing both the legs on the alternate thighs, you should start by <strong>placing one leg<\/strong> on the corresponding thigh and keeping the other leg straight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, when you get comfortable with the half bit of the position, you could start <strong>performing the full Lotus pose<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- IMAGE 16:9 -->\n<div class=\"image-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"individual\">\n  <div>\n  <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/tint_magazine_lotus-pose_padmasana_cristi-christensen.png\">\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<!-- CAPTION -->\n<p class=\"caption\">You can also opt for easier versions instead of the full Lotus pose. <i>Photo: TINT Instructor <a href=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/instructors\/cristi-christensen\/\">Cristi Christensen<\/a><\/i>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>You shouldn\u2019t be doing this yoga pose if you have a sprain in your ankle or suffer from any other foot injury.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone in their post-surgery period should also avoid this asana.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same goes for back pain. If you have one, don\u2019t opt for Lotus pose or <em>Padmasana<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n<span style=\"--tl-form-height-m:1213.05px;--tl-form-height-t:638.781px;--tl-form-height-d:638.781px;\" class=\"tl-placeholder-f-type-shortcode_158494 tl-preload-form\"><span><\/span><\/span>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4\">4. Where to Practice Lotus Pose (Padmasana)?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This yoga pose dates back centuries, particularly in the Southeast Asian region, more concentrated in and around the Indian Subcontinent. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While <em>Padmasana<\/em> gets its name from the pose of a lotus flower, it also does miraculous healing and wonders for the human body.
