It&#8217;s a universal language that can cross all races and religions. Nowadays especially, with the use of the internet and in our globalized world, music can reach everywhere. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>How did you develop your passion for music?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Growing up, <strong>music meant a lot to me<\/strong>. It has always been my passion. My mother used to play music for me when I went to bed, and I&#8217;d have my own little radio to listen to music on at home. As a teenager, I&#8217;d start buying CDs and figuring out what kind of music I like. In high school, then, I saved up for my own turntables. I got into deejaying. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Did you always plan on becoming a music artist?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Really, my two passions growing up were basketball (and sports in general) and music. I never thought I&#8217;d become a music artist, though, I always wanted to be an athlete. As I got older, however, <strong>I realized how powerful music is<\/strong>. It brings enjoyment to people and can transform peoples&#8217; lives with how healing it is. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing people transform on the dancefloor, getting out of their bodies and minds, that is special to me. It&#8217;s a sort of <strong>movement medication<\/strong>. I guess that&#8217;s my roundabout way of saying: Music means a lot to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>How do you want your audience to feel when listening to your music?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d love for my music to have an emotional impact on my audience. For me personally, <strong>music makes me feel something<\/strong>. Whether that is sadness, joy, or an appreciation for beauty, it impacts me. Music needs to move me in a certain way in order for me to appreciate the beautiful side of things. That way, it has a dreamy, emotional, beautiful impact on me. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since I have a background in hip hop, having been a competitive scratch DJ, <strong>music is special to me in many ways<\/strong>. I think all in all, music helps people get through difficult times. It always means a lot to me when people tell me that my music had an impact on them, and that it helped them get through difficult times in their life. That&#8217;s really why I do what I do. I enjoy making music, but I love hearing that it has an impact on people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Where do you find inspiration for the music you produce?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, in general, <strong>I&#8217;m always working and creating music<\/strong>. I&#8217;m a bit of a workaholic. I guess I can&#8217;t really stop! Generally, though, I listen to a lot of different artists and genres. I think every artist kind of does that, you are inspired by everything you hear, and that variety influences every piece of art ever created. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, when creating, <strong>I reach this zone or flow<\/strong> you could call it, and sometimes I can&#8217;t remember how I made a song after having made it. I guess I&#8217;d probably not be able to recreate a song twice in the same way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- IMAGE 16:9 -->\n<div class=\"image-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"individual\">\n  <div>\n   <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/TINT_Magazine_HipHopYoga_CrazyInLove.jpg\">\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<!-- CAPTION -->\n<p class=\"caption\">Sol Rising even created some Inside Flow songs, e.g. for Young Ho Kim&#8217;s Flow <a href=\"https:\/\/watch.tintyoga.com\/programs\/inside-flow-crazy-in-love\">Crazy in Love<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4>How do you think music changes a person&#8217;s life (or yoga practice)?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For yoga, I think music can be very inspiring. It&#8217;s interesting to choose music for a specific part of the class, like <em>Savasana<\/em>, a warm-up or the beginning of the class. My music in general is geared towards the different parts of the yoga practice. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can music change lives? Well, especially during this pandemic (Note: This interview was held \u2013 digitally \u2013 during the Covid-19 pandemic), <strong>music can be therapeutic<\/strong>. It helps you get through the day, brings joy into your life. The positive vibration of music helps people through difficult areas of life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Can you recommend any artists to our readers?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure.
