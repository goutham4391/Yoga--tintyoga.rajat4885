Start in <strong>Warrior 1<\/strong>.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>2. Place both hands onto the hip bones. The front leg is going to be the <strong>standing leg<\/strong>.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>3. Lift your back heel to straighten the foot and further square the hips. <strong>Tuck your navel<\/strong> in and up.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>4. Keep the standing leg bent while you start <strong>shifting your bodyweight <\/strong>slowly onto your front leg.\u00a0Start activating\u00a0your back muscles.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>5. Place or pull the back foot a few centimeters forward. Your gaze (<em>Drishti<\/em>) is <strong>focussed on a non-moving point<\/strong> on the ground, about half a meter in front of your standing foot.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>6. Once you feel safe and well-balanced, inhale and <strong>lift the back leg<\/strong> by engaging your back thigh muscles and glutes. Your weight is evenly distributed on the four corners of your standing leg\u2019s foot.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>7. Keep the <strong>pelvis straight<\/strong> like in Warrior 1, meaning parallel to the mat, and tilt your upper body forward, so that your chest is also parallel to the mat. If it is available to you, your back leg and your upper body are in line with each other.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>8. Flex the lifted back foot, toes point down, and engage the foot by actively pushing the heel away from you.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>9. Your <strong>standing leg remains micro-bent<\/strong> and engaged &#8211; you are allowed to be slightly shaky. Focus on the engagement of all necessary muscles and you will find more balance. Remember your <em>Drishti<\/em>.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>10. The crown of your head pulls away from your shoulders, <strong>elongating the neck and spine<\/strong>.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>11. If it is available to you and you feel in balance, then reach your arms towards the front of your mat. Keep them strong, your shoulders might lift slightly to move your ribcage forward and up to\u00a0give your lungs more room to breathe.\u00a0 Your palms face each other and your fingers are engaged.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>12. Remember to <strong>breathe consciously<\/strong> through your nose (ujjayi breath). Back foot and hands reach away from each other and stretch.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>13. To release the pose, exhale, bend the standing leg more and place your lifted foot back onto the ground.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>14.

So the <strong>back muscles are strong<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Moreover, the <em>psoas minor <\/em>and the abdominal muscles contract to <strong>prevent the lumbar spine from hyperextending<\/strong>. To help with the abs, tuck the navel in and up.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>The sternum is minimally lifted proudly, and the chest is open. The neck muscles contract as well to <strong>support the cervical spine<\/strong> carrying the head\u2019s weight.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>In addition, the shoulders are abducted and, if the arms reach forward above the head, the <strong>arms are pronated<\/strong> and the triceps engaged. The muscles in hands and fingers are actively extended.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h3>2.2. Lower Body<\/h3>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s move on to the <strong>lower body<\/strong>:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>In the <strong>standing leg<\/strong>, the quad muscles are engaged, the <em>articularis genu<\/em> and <em>vastii<\/em> flex to lift the patella of the knee. The glute muscles contract to support the abduction and flexion of the hip. The pelvis bones are parallel to the ground and slightly tilted up. All muscles of the foot support the integrity of the foot.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>In the <strong>back leg<\/strong>, the femur is internally rotated so that the knee and foot both point to the ground. Also here, the hamstrings, quads, and muscles around the knee contract to lift the leg and the patella. The foot muscles and calf are engaged to flex the foot.

Do you find this a not very yogi-like image for an asana due to its principle of non-violence (<em>ahimsa<\/em>)? Then find out about the mythological background of the <a href=\"https:\/\/jivamuktiyoga.com\/fotm\/warrior-poses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">warrior poses<\/a> now and you will understand this image.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><em>Virabhadrasana<\/em> originates from the name <strong>Virabhadra<\/strong> who, as it is said, was a <strong>warrior created by Shiva\u2019s anger<\/strong> and despair. But let\u2019s go back slightly in the story: Daksha, father of Sati who is the wife of Shiva, does not approve of Shiva as a son-in-law. So he excludes Shiva from family events, even shuns him to demonstrate his disdain. This upsets Sati to a degree that the fire burning inside of her grows until she bursts into flames. Now, Shiva, in his grief and anger, cuts off one of his dreadlocks, throws it on the floor &#8211; and then Virabhadra appears. Shiva tells him to <strong>storm the Daksha\u2019s palace<\/strong>, Sati\u2019s father and king, as revenge.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Here come the warrior asanas: So Virabhadra bows one knee and raises the arms up in service of Shiva who orders him to lead the army (<strong>Warrior 1<\/strong>). Then Virabhadra wields his sword and is ready for battle (<strong>Warrior 2<\/strong>) and to take the army to the palace. When they arrive, he finds Daksha and <strong>swings his sword to behead him<\/strong> (Warrior 3).\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>When Shiva sees and realizes the damage his ordered army has done, he regrets the innocent lives lost. As a sign of letting go of his anger and replacing it with compassion, he replaces Daksha\u2019s head with the head of a goat. Thereby, he resurrects Daksha who then bows to Shiva to show his respect towards him and Shiva\u2019s deep love and loyalty to Sati (<strong>Humble Warrior<\/strong>).\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>As is often the case with stories, there is a <strong>meaning<\/strong> behind it or a lesson to be learned: <em>Virabhadrasana<\/em> does not actually refer to fighting. Rather, it metaphorically reminds yogis <strong>to overcome the ego, the mind, and self-ignorance<\/strong>. It states: Be brave, stand firm, and take action in tough times, connecting to your heart\u2019s whisper and inner strength.\u00a0That way, Warrior 3 helps you to push through inner conflicts.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"video-wrapper-inner\">\n<p class=\"video-description\">Sianna Sherman&#8217;s series <a href=\"https:\/\/watch.tintyoga.com\/programs\/rasa-yoga-warrior-practice\">Rasa Warrior Practice<\/a> takes you on a journey through the mythology behind various warriors and on to exploring how their strengths can be found within you.<\/p>\n<p><!-- YOUTUBE VIDEO GOES HERE --><br \/><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/pGoHPjQ55M0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"4\">4.

When integrating it into the sequence, it is important to remember that Warrior 3 is an <strong>intermediate standing balance<\/strong>. We collected a few examples of <a href=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/magazine\/yoga-standing-poses\/\">standing asanas<\/a> that almost naturally let yogis ease into the strength of Virabhadrasana 3:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mountain pose (<em><a href=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/magazine\/tadasana-mountain-yoga-pose\/\">Tadasana<\/a><\/em>)<\/li>\n<li>Warrior 1\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Warrior 2\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>High Lunge.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>When <strong>teaching experienced yogis<\/strong>, you might enjoy transitioning from the following standing balances into Virabhadrasana 3. They offer to keep the leg off the ground at all times while the standing leg might start burning:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Half-Moon pose (<em><a href=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/magazine\/half-moon-yoga-pose\/\">Ardha Chandrasana<\/a><\/em>)\u00a0\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Eagle pose (<em>Garudasana<\/em>)\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Hand To Big Toe pose (<em>Utthita Hasta Padangusthasana<\/em>).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Some of these asanas also make <strong>good follow-up poses <\/strong>when coming out of Warrior 3, like stepping back into High Lunge or coming back to Tadasana. Additionally, afterwards you might enjoy transitioning into:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chair pose (<em><a href=\"https:\/\/magazine.tintyoga.com\/utkatasana-chair-pose\">Utkatasana<\/a><\/em>)<\/li>\n<li>Tree pose (<em><a href=\"https:\/\/magazine.tintyoga.com\/tree-pose-vrksasana\">Vrksasana<\/a><\/em>)\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Standing Half-bound Lotus (<em>Ardha Baddha Padmottanasana<\/em>)<\/li>\n<li>Figure 4 (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pocketyoga.com\/pose\/figure_four#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eka Pada Utkatasana<\/a>).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Always keep in mind the level your students are at and give options if it is a mixed class and you still like to offer challenges to body and mind.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"--tl-form-height-m:1213.05px;--tl-form-height-t:638.781px;--tl-form-height-d:638.781px;\" class=\"tl-placeholder-f-type-shortcode_158494 tl-preload-form\"><span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"5\">5. What Are Possible Warrior 3 Variations?<\/h2>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>There are several options that help reaching Virabhadrasana 3 step by step.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Of course, you may <strong>stop lifting your leg<\/strong> at the degree that feels comfortable for you. You may even start by keeping the tips of your toes on the ground and leaning forward only slightly, remaining the torso and back leg in line. From practice to practice, you will be able to lean forward more and to lift the back leg further.<\/li>\n<li>You may <strong>use a chair<\/strong> to gently hold onto to help you with the balance. Make sure you do not rest them on the chair but keep the arms engaged.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>You may place your back <strong>foot against a wall<\/strong>. This will help you balance while you actively push your foot away from you into the wall, engaging your core and leg muscles.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>If you notice that straightening your arms above your head causes you to lose balance, then you may either bring your <strong>hands to heart-center<\/strong> in Anjali Mudra, reach your arms sideways, or <strong>reach your arms backwards<\/strong> like the wings of an airplane, palms facing towards the ground. The latter option will help you open your chest and ease your shoulders and neck if you struggle with tightness or soreness in that area.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>If it feels good with your neck and shoulders while your arms reach forward, you may also <strong>interlock your hands<\/strong> and point your index fingers (Kali Mudra).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>For an increasing feeling of security and stability in your standing balances, we put together the <a href=\"https:\/\/tintyoga.com\/magazine\/yoga-balance-poses\/\">10 most helpful recommendations<\/a> on how to improve similar asanas.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"6\">6. When To Avoid Virabhadrasana 3?\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>There are a few <strong>contraindications<\/strong> that, if they are known to the yogi, require to refrain from practicing Warrior 3 or to stay in the option of leaving the toes of the back foot on the ground and only slightly leaning forward:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronic back, shoulder, hip or leg injury: If your body screams pain, don\u2019t do it. This accounts for any asana.<\/li>\n<li>Pregnancy: choose an easy option here, so the abdominals do not need to be engaged<\/li>\n<li>High blood pressure: For some people, the rush of blood to the head may cause dizziness or similar uncomfortable bodily sensations.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"7\">7. What Are the Benefits of Warrior 3 Pose?<\/h2>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Virabhadrasana 3 truly <strong>engages the whole body<\/strong>, resulting in several benefits on both a physical and an energetic level.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Regarding your physique, Warrior 3 <strong>benefits glutes and the hip stabilizers<\/strong> as well as the muscles in legs and feet, strengthening their deep tissue. Moreover, it <strong>empowers the core and back muscles<\/strong> that need to cooperate to support each other and become the powerhouse of your body. These muscles also help neutralize, <strong>align and elongate your spine<\/strong>. Overall, your <strong>stability<\/strong> as well as your ability to balance increase.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Another physical benefit of Virabhadrasana 3 is the <strong>active opening and stretching of the chest<\/strong> and shoulder muscles that, especially in today\u2019s smartphone age of slumped upper backs, realign and thereby improve your overall <strong>healthy posture<\/strong>. This also widens the rib cage slightly, giving the lungs more room and thereby <strong>enhancing your lungs&#8217; capacity<\/strong>. Since Warrior 3 involves several muscles and requires a great amount of attention to alignment, the asana supports your <strong>full-body coordination<\/strong>.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>On an energetic level, Warrior 3 also benefits your inner <strong>emotional and energetic balance<\/strong>. It will calm you and help you <strong>clear your mind<\/strong>. The intensity of the pose requires and thereby fosters your <strong>ability to focus and concentrate<\/strong>. When holding the pose and breathing, your awareness of your own inner strength, your ability to move and balance, and your inner energy increases.

All muscles of the foot support the integrity of the foot.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the <strong>back leg<\/strong>, the femur is internally rotated so that the knee and foot both point to the ground.

But let\u2019s go back slightly in the story: Daksha, father of Sati who is the wife of Shiva, does not approve of Shiva as a son-in-law. So he excludes Shiva from family events, even shuns him to demonstrate his disdain. This upsets Sati to a degree that the fire burning inside of her grows until she bursts into flames. Now, Shiva, in his grief and anger, cuts off one of his dreadlocks, throws it on the floor - and then Virabhadra appears. Shiva tells him to <strong>storm the Daksha\u2019s palace<\/strong>, Sati\u2019s father and king, as revenge.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here come the warrior asanas: So Virabhadra bows one knee and raises the arms up in service of Shiva who orders him to lead the army (<strong>Warrior 1<\/strong>). Then Virabhadra wields his sword and is ready for battle (<strong>Warrior 2<\/strong>) and to take the army to the palace. When they arrive, he finds Daksha and <strong>swings his sword to behead him<\/strong> (Warrior 3).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When Shiva sees and realizes the damage his ordered army has done, he regrets the innocent lives lost. As a sign of letting go of his anger and replacing it with compassion, he replaces Daksha\u2019s head with the head of a goat. Thereby, he resurrects Daksha who then bows to Shiva to show his respect towards him and Shiva\u2019s deep love and loyalty to Sati (<strong>Humble Warrior<\/strong>).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As is often the case with stories, there is a <strong>meaning<\/strong> behind it or a lesson to be learned: <em>Virabhadrasana<\/em> does not actually refer to fighting.

Overall, your <strong>stability<\/strong> as well as your ability to balance increase.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another physical benefit of Virabhadrasana 3 is the <strong>active opening and stretching of the chest<\/strong> and shoulder muscles that, especially in today\u2019s smartphone age of slumped upper backs, realign and thereby improve your overall <strong>healthy posture<\/strong>. This also widens the rib cage slightly, giving the lungs more room and thereby <strong>enhancing your lungs' capacity<\/strong>.
