<p class="intro-text">Traditionally, <strong>yoga</strong> was not primarily intended as a <strong>therapeutic</strong> practice or <strong>therapy</strong> for injured or sick persons. It was rather for healthy people who were interested in, and capable of, improving their general health and fitness as well as their mental well-being.</p>



<p>While yoga is <strong>neither physical nor psychological therapy</strong>, many yoga practices contain therapeutic elements. However, it’s mainly a tradition of psycho-spiritual growth leading to inner peace and freedom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Western societies, yoga is nowadays almost universally pursued as a health fitness routine that <strong>has proven to be highly effective </strong>and is, thus, discovered by more and more people. And quite a few practitioners turn to yoga for therapeutic purposes – be it to <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/search?custom_fields=%7B%22custom_field_5271%22%3A%228%22%7D">soothe physical pain</a> or overcome mental challenges such as stress or anxiety. But what is therapeutic yoga actually? And how is it different from ‘regular’ yoga?</p>

<h1 id="1">1.&nbsp;What Is Therapeutic Yoga?</h1>



<p>Yoga therapy or therapeutic yoga is a form of therapy that applies yoga practices to <strong>improve mental and physical health</strong>. While yoga is generally associated with stress relief, yoga therapy, in particular, can help to treat several other mental health conditions. As such, it can even be applied in combination with other types of therapy.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.iayt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Association of Yoga Therapists</a> (IAYT), which is responsible for certifying yoga therapists and accrediting yoga therapy schools, defines the term <em>yoga therapy</em> as follows:&nbsp;</p>



<div class="quote-wrapper">
<p class="quote">&#8220;Yoga therapy is the professional application of the principles and practices of yoga to promote health and well-being within a therapeutic relationship that includes personalized assessment, goal setting, lifestyle management, and yoga practices for individuals or small groups.&#8221;</p>
<p class="quote-author">– International Association of Yoga Therapists.</p>
</div>



<p><a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/search?custom_fields=%7B%22custom_field_5271%22%3A%228%22%7D">Therapeutic yoga</a> includes techniques and practices that <strong>support the body to deal with physical issues</strong> such as tension, pains and aches and – to a certain degree – injuries. The aim is to release tension and relieve the body from unpleasant sensations. Instead of flowing through powerful <a href="https://tools.tintyoga.com/">sequences</a>, the focus rather is on static poses. These poses target specific body parts and areas of the body to strengthen and lengthen them in order to achieve long-term benefits and increase overall well-being.</p>



<p>In summary, yoga therapy is intended as a <strong>preventative, curative, or palliative practice</strong> – depending on the individual’s needs. Ideally, therapeutic yoga is an empowering experience that leaves practitioners with an increased feeling of overall well-being.</p>

<h1 id="1">2.&nbsp;Difference Between Therapeutic Yoga and Yoga</h1>



<p>Although yoga, in general, is intended to be therapeutic and healing, yoga therapy refers to the <strong>specific use of yogic practices</strong> aimed at alleviating the practitioners’ physical, mental, and emotional suffering. These tools include anything from yoga poses (<em>Asana</em>), breathing exercises (<a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/pranayama-an-intro-to-the-power-of-yogic-breathing/"><em>Pranayama</em></a>), <a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/quietening-our-thougths-through-meditation/">meditation</a>, and other physical exercises and <a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/yoga-meditation-a-practice-of-mindfulness/">mindfulness</a> practices.</p>



<p>If you compare a therapeutic yoga class to your average yoga class, you will certainly find some overlaps. However, there are also differences.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>2.1. Therapeutic Yoga Clients vs. Yoga Students</h2>



<p>While the aim of a ‘regular’ student in a ‘regular’ yoga class (note: We use the word ‘regular’ here in contrast to ‘therapeutic’.) usually is to stay healthy and fit, increase and maintain flexibility, or find mental and emotional balance, a student in a therapeutic yoga class will want to <strong>address specific physical, mental and/or emotional needs</strong>.</p>



<p>Thus, <strong>yoga therapy</strong> can be more specifically defined as “the process of empowering individuals to progress toward improved health and well-being through the application of the teachings and practices of yoga” (according to the IAYT).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In contrast to the regular yoga student, who is usually in good health, yoga therapy clients usually have been <strong>diagnosed with a physical or mental health issue</strong>. In addition to other potential medical or therapeutic approaches, they are looking for complementary means to resolve their health problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why yoga therapists usually spend a lot of time <strong>listening and observing their clients </strong>during practice. This way, they are able to find different ways to alleviate their clients’ symptoms and improve their body’s functionality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means that yoga therapy includes yoga <strong>techniques that are tailored to the individual client </strong>so that they may practice them at their convenience. The intention behind this approach is to give yoga therapy students the feeling of self-efficacy, i.e. they learn that they are in control of their recovery instead of being at the mercy of their health condition.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>2.2. Therapeutic Focus</h2>



<p>You may have already noticed though that the difference between yoga and therapeutic yoga/yoga therapy is not always that obvious. You may think that any time a person practices yoga in order to relieve or overcome a health condition, they practice yoga therapy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is true to some extent as many yoga practitioners seek to <strong>improve their strength, flexibility, and overall well-being</strong>. More and more people also engage in yoga because they hope to manage or improve specific physical or mental health conditions. Nowadays, as the popularity of yoga rises on all continents of the world, it has become established in the public psyche that yoga can have significant <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3193654/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">therapeutic benefits</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But therapeutic yoga goes beyond a ‘regular’ yoga practice. Yoga therapy applies yoga and mindfulness practices <strong>based on scientific research </strong>in order to offer a comprehensive, effective and efficient approach to alleviating health conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The aim of yoga therapy is to <strong>get a full picture of the clients’ symptoms </strong>that trouble them and, as a result, identify the most appropriate yogic methods to manage these symptoms. In many cases, this often goes along with other pharmaceutical and/or therapeutic treatments.</p>



<p>Yoga therapy also aims at empowering practitioners to <strong>overcome their health challenges</strong> by means of practices that they can easily integrate into their lives. This way, they gain independence as they are able to take a more active role in their self-care.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>2.3. The Yoga Therapist’s Skill Set</h2>



<p>Yoga therapy requires specialized training and <strong>a broad skill set </strong>in order to be able to build a strong relationship between the yoga therapy student (often referred to as ‘client’) and yoga therapy teacher (also referred to as ‘yoga therapist’). This is necessary in order to effect positive change for the client.</p>



<p>Furthermore, yoga therapy combines <strong>knowledge from a variety of fields</strong>: from modern research in anatomy and physiology to medical studies, psychology, and yoga.</p>



<p>It must be mentioned here that yoga, contrary to common belief, is not necessarily suitable for everyone. Or more specifically: <strong>Not every yoga practice is suitable for everyone</strong>. </p>



<p>The truth is that many yoga poses that are taught in regular yoga classes <em>(check out a variety of them in our tool, the <a href="https://tools.tintyoga.com/">Yoga Sequence Builder</a>)</em> are contraindicated for people with health issues such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, or autoimmune diseases. The same goes for participants with physical ailments including serious posture imbalances, scoliosis, herniated discs, hip dysplasia, and others. </p>



<p>What is more, yoga can also be counterproductive for people suffering from mental illnesses such as eating disorders, clinical depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder if the teacher is not sufficiently trained.</p>



<p>This is why the yoga therapist needs to have <strong>sound knowledge of modern medicine</strong> and <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/overcoming-trauma-through-yoga/">trauma-informed psychology</a> in order to safely and effectively meet the yoga therapy students’ needs. In some cases, it may even be advisable to collaborate with other health practitioners to continuously develop yoga therapy as an adapted, safe and complementary treatment form.</p>

</div>



<h2>2.4. Application of Therapeutic Yoga&nbsp;</h2>



<p>With <strong>new insights and regular updates</strong> regarding new medical treatments for disease, yoga therapy also needs to continuously develop and adapt. For example, yoga inversions have long been considered the most important <em>Asanas</em> as they were thought to be beneficial for the brain as a preparation for meditation. Thanks to modern medical research and insights we know today that inversions can <a href="https://www.expandinglight.org/free/yoga-teacher/articles/general/inversions-cardiovascular-heart.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cause a stroke</a> in people with a predisposition for cardiovascular diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In contrast to that, inversions have long been contraindicated for menstruating women as it was thought that the blood from the uterus may penetrate into other organs. Needless to say that this has also been proven wrong.</p>



<p>This is why yoga therapy (and – to be frank – ANY yoga practice) <strong>demands a highly developed skill set</strong> including knowledge about a variety of contraindications, modifications, and variations that need to be implemented when working with clients with special needs due to, for example, obesity, elevated blood pressure, diabetics, herniated discs and other back problems, or a history of heart disease.</p>



<p>In addition to that, yoga therapy also is both <strong>trauma-informed and trauma-sensitive</strong> based on the work of Bessel van der Kolk and other specialists in this field. This is why it can also be applied as a supplementary treatment in trauma therapy and to approach psychological and psycho-somatic ailments like depression, anxiety, and panic disorders or eating disorders.</p>





<p></p>



<h1 id="3">3. What Does a Yoga Therapist Do?</h1>



<p>As mentioned above, there is some overlap in the work of yoga teachers and yoga therapists, but each has a different focus and particular skill set.</p>



<h2>3.1. Tailor-Made Training&nbsp;</h2>



<p>While yoga teachers usually aim at delivering an overall yoga experience to their students, yoga therapists target their clients’ specific issues and support them with <strong>tailor-made techniques</strong> that contribute specifically to their physical, emotional, and/or psychological health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therapeutic yoga teachers need a <strong>more thorough and deeper training and academic work</strong> in order to gain the medical knowledge and psychotherapeutic skills required to meet people’s various health needs and to provide yogic techniques that are suitable for their clients’ health status.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>3.2. Assessment and Individualised Treatment&nbsp;</h2>



<p>While yoga therapy can be applied in a group setting or on a one-on-one basis, there are some basic steps any yoga therapist will need to follow. Typically, a yoga therapist will start by <strong>assessing their clients’ health status</strong> in order to design a program that is aimed at alleviating their specific symptoms. An individualised treatment plan will then be drawn up and, depending on the clients’ response, may be modified as the treatment progresses.</p>



<p>This means that yoga therapists must <strong>understand why their clients have come to them</strong> and decide what they can do to help them. This is why yoga therapists should also be trained in listening, questioning, observing, and touching skills in order to assess clients in the best possible way.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>3.3. Comprehensive Training and Qualifications</h2>



<p>Also, in contrast to ‘general’ yoga teachers, those with a therapeutic approach to yoga will benefit from <strong>more comprehensive training </strong>to avoid health complications during treatment and to be aware of potential contraindications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, a qualified yoga therapist will have to complete special training to develop the necessary skills such as:</p>



<ul><li>the ability to read and understand <strong>medical diagnoses</strong>;</li><li>knowledge of a wide range of both physical and mental health issues and associated <strong>contraindications</strong>;</li><li>a basic understanding of typical <strong>symptomes</strong>, maybe even depending on the client’s current disease state.</li><li>awareness of the effects of <strong>medication</strong> and, as a result, potential contraindications;</li><li>a comprehensive understanding of the roles of <strong>other health professionals </strong>in order to refer clients when they need additional support;</li><li>awareness of the <strong>limitations of their work</strong> as a yoga therapist, i.e. they must consider whether they are sufficiently qualified to address aspects of a certain condition; and, of course,</li><li>knowledge of <strong>yoga practices and techniques</strong> and their application with regard to a particular diagnosis.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<h1 id="4">4. How Does Yoga Therapy Work?</h1>



<p>Yoga, as we often practice it in the West, usually focuses on the <strong>physical practice </strong>of <em>Asanas</em> in a group (fitness) setting. Sometimes, pranayama and meditation are incorporated. In general, students adapt their practice according to the yoga teacher and the yoga style and <a href="https://tools.tintyoga.com/">yoga sequence</a> that is being taught. </p>



<p>This doesn’t mean that yoga, in general, doesn’t already provide a lot of <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/yoga-benefits-beyond-the-mat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benefits</a> for practitioners. However, these are usually general and not aimed at specific physical and/or emotional conditions.</p>



<h2>4.1. Client-Focused Approach</h2>



<p>Therapeutic yoga, on the other hand, <strong>focuses on the individual practitioner</strong> and takes into account their specific needs and, in particular, health restrictions. It uses a comprehensive approach to help improve the practitioners’ overall health and well-being by applying various yoga techniques. </p>



<p>As such, therapeutic yoga is not only taught by yoga teachers or therapists but is also used by <strong>physical therapists and psychologists</strong> to heal, for example, chronic pain or emotional trauma.</p>



<p>By choosing techniques in relation to how they will specifically benefit individual clients with certain health conditions, therapeutic yoga can help <strong>manage the symptoms of different diseases</strong>. These range from chronic pain to fatigue, or sleeplessness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, yoga therapy can empower clients to take <strong>a more active role in self-care </strong>to overcome their health issues and gain independence.</p>



<h2>4.2. Impacts on Mental Health</h2>



<p>A <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/55/17/992" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2021 study</a> found that yoga, therapeutically applied, can help manage a variety of psychological conditions. And a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22132353/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2011 study</a> suggests that yoga therapy can be applied as a complementary form of therapy for mental health illnesses. Usually, it also has fewer side effects than medication.</p>



<p>To be more specific, yoga therapy can help with the <strong>treatment of mental health conditions</strong> such as:</p>



<ul><li>Alcohol and substance dependence</li><li>Anxiety and panic disorders</li><li>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</li><li>Autism</li><li>Bipolar disorder</li><li>Depression</li><li>Eating disorders</li><li>Insomnia</li><li>Post-traumatic stress disorder</li><li>Schizophrenia</li><li>Stress</li></ul>



<p>What is more, therapeutic yoga does not only have positive impacts on mental health but can also be effective in <strong>treating physical health conditions</strong> like chronic pain caused by stress or trauma that has been stored in the body and manifests through bodily symptoms. So, yoga therapy has a variety of other objectives and benefits.</p>



<h2>4.3. Objectives and Benefits of Yoga Therapy</h2>



<h3>Mind-Body Focus&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The exercises and techniques used in yoga therapy focus on the mind and body simultaneously. This way, it supports practitioners in developing both <strong>mental and physical awareness</strong>. This improves their mind-body connection and trains their mindfulness.</p>



<h3>Improves Overall Fitness</h3>



<p>Therapeutic yoga does not only hold benefits for the sick and injured. Persons with no specific health issues can also benefit from therapeutic yoga classes and improve their physical fitness, correct their posture and increase strength, balance, and flexibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yoga therapy is also said to have <strong>positive effects on poor health conditions </strong>such as high blood pressure, overweight, poor posture, and poor fitness in general.</p>



<h3>Fewer Side Effects</h3>



<p>Any medication that is used to treat mental or physical health conditions can have side effects. In some medications, the list may be longer and scarier than in others. In contrast to that, yoga therapy – if applied correctly and by a well-trained therapist – has few to no side effects.</p>



<h3>Alternative Form of Therapy</h3>



<p>Finally, conventional medicine also has its limits. There are some individuals or conditions where mainstream medicine may not provide the desired cure. In other instances, the side effects of medication and/or treatment may simply be too scary for the individual to bear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In such cases, yoga therapy can be a great<strong> alternative or additional form of therapy</strong>, especially for those who find more meaningful results through a holistic mind-body approach.</p>





<h2>4.4. Techniques Used in Yoga Therapy</h2>



<p>Yoga therapy is typically performed on a one-on-one basis, but can also be practiced in small groups. In these cases, the power of the group may even amplify the healing process.</p>



<p>A therapeutic yoga class can include the application of the following techniques.</p>



<h3>Yoga Poses/Asanas</h3>



<p>Like any yoga class, therapeutic yoga includes a <a href="https://tools.tintyoga.com/">variety of poses</a> that are called <em>Asanas</em>. In yoga therapy, the therapist will specifically choose and teach appropriate <strong>yoga poses that address the clients’ problem areas</strong>. Here, yoga props such as blocks, straps or chairs are commonly used to support the client.</p>



<p>For example, a gentle and rather accessible inversion in a therapeutic yoga class may be the “Legs Up the Wall” pose (instead of Shoulderstand for instance). This position is said to bring relief in conditions like anxiety and insomnia.</p>

<p class="caption">Practice a therapeutic approach to release neck &amp; shoulder with Young Ho Kim on TINT.</p>

</div>
</div>



<h3>Breathing Exercises/Pranayama</h3>



<p>The yoga therapist will guide the client(s) through a series of breathing exercises, also called <em>Pranayama</em> in yoga. These practices can range from energizing breathwork to balancing breathing exercises.</p>



<h3>Meditation and Relaxation</h3>



<p>Yoga therapy can also include relaxation and mindfulness practices. This is where meditation can be used either separately or in combination with <em>Asanas</em> or <em>Pranayama</em>.</p>



<h3>Visualization</h3>



<p>Yoga therapists may also use visualization practices or guided imagery. The aim here is to calm the body and mind by providing a guided visualization in order to bring inner peace.</p>



<p>More traditional forms of yoga therapy can also include techniques such as chanting, prayer, readings, rituals, and spiritual counseling.</p>



<h3>Homework</h3>



<p>Another important technique used in yoga therapy – and this again differs from the ‘regular’ yoga class – is homework. Students or clients will benefit tremendously if they learn to <strong>build the practices into their daily life</strong> instead of practicing them only once a week in the context of a therapeutic yoga class.</p>



<p>The treatment plan and techniques employed in yoga therapy usually vary according to <strong>age, physical ability, and specific needs </strong>of the students or clients. Besides, all exercises and techniques used in yoga therapy are aimed at maximizing the connection between mind and body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While this is true for any yoga practice, a yoga therapist will specifically explain the importance and meaning of each exercise and yoga pose with regard to the underlying health concern. This way, yoga therapy creates a bridge between the practice and its cognitive framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a practitioner suffers from anxiety, for example, a yoga therapist will explain how the poses practiced can help relieve anxiety.</p>



<h1 id="5">5. Conclusion: Is Yoga Therapy an Alternative to Medical Treatment?</h1>



<p>While yoga therapy does not claim to be disease-curative, <strong>it can address various symptoms </strong>that may accompany illnesses or health issues, specifically pain, fatigue, and mental challenges.</p>



<p>As such, <strong>yoga therapy can be used in addition to other forms of therapy.</strong> Note that it should always be considered whether and to what extent therapeutic yoga practices can be helpful to the individual and how it would work in combination with other forms of therapy.</p>



<p>Although many clients report great results from yoga therapy, it is important to remember that <strong>yoga is not a cure-all or magical bullet</strong>. Besides, the communication between therapy seeker and therapy giver must be very clear as to the underlying health issues, medical history, and desired outcome of yoga therapy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if this is taken into account, <strong>anyone can participate in yoga therapy</strong> regardless of age, flexibility, or strength. This is especially true since therapeutic yoga sessions can be simple or advanced, depending on the abilities and needs of the students or clients.</p>



<p>If you want to dive deeper into yoga therapy and the application of therapeutic yoga practices, make sure you check out the <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/categories/live-stream-replay">replays of the live classes</a> involving therapeutic approaches to yoga.  </p>



<p>Each session includes techniques and practices that <strong>support the body to deal with physical issues </strong>such as tension, pains and aches, and – to a certain degree – injuries. The aim is to release tension and relieve the body from unpleasant sensations.</p>



<p>While Young Ho Kim,  Desirée Rumbaugh and Matt Giordano all focused on different parts of the body like the lower back and the shoulders, they all rather practice static poses instead of powerful flows to strengthen and lengthen those areas of the body in order to achieve long-term benefits and increase overall well-being.</p>

<p>Have you ever come across the topic of trauma? It is still one of the less discussed topics in our society. Even though more and <strong>more relevant research about trauma</strong> and how to heal it is being done. </p>



<p>Similarly, integrating trauma informed approaches in the yoga world remains a niche topic. The reason behind this article is to illuminate the <strong>effective role of yoga</strong> when working with trauma.</p>



<p>This article is part of a two part series on trauma and yoga. There will be  a follow up article on tips on how to teach yoga in a trauma sensitive way.</p>

<h1 id="1">1. The Importance of Knowing About Trauma</h1>



<p></p>



<p>Why is it important for yoga teachers (and practitioners) to know about trauma?<br><br>Trauma specialists recommend educating about trauma in all kinds of areas. From school teachers to jail workers to everyone working in health and wellness professions, which naturally also includes yoga teachers. This could help to <strong>relieve trauma symptoms</strong> and even help to <strong>prevent trauma</strong> from manifesting in the first place. </p>



<p>So let&#8217;s take a closer look.</p>



<h2 id="2">1.1 What Is Trauma?</h2>



<p>The term trauma can be quite confusing. Most people think of heavy events such as war, natural disasters, displacement, accidents or (sexual) violence when hearing the term trauma. Or they think of the more frequently used reference to trauma relating to the <a href="https://www.aftertrauma.org/what-is-trauma/what-is-trauma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medical trauma</a>. This refers to trauma resulting from blunt or penetrating forces outside of the body like falls, cuts or other impacts. All these events happen to <strong>contain elements of shock and terror</strong> and can certainly hold the potential for trauma. As there are different types of trauma, let’s take a more detailed look.</p>



<h3>Shock Trauma</h3>



<p>Trauma research expands the term to literally any event that evokes shock, terror or other sensations and feelings which result in a <strong>feeling of overwhelm and helplessness</strong>. This could be something as “normal” as a break up, a divorce, the sudden death of a loved one or a surgery. </p>



<p>So we can see that trauma does not necessarily have to result from a life-threatening event. These traumas are called shock traumas. They are <strong>single events exceeding the capacity of our inner resources</strong>. Common symptoms <em>can</em> be flashbacks, dissociation and a whole range of symptoms known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20355967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PTSD</a> (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).</p>



<h3>Developmental Trauma</h3>



<p>Another form of trauma is the so-called developmental trauma. Here the feeling of overwhelm and helplessness happens not only once, but <strong>repeatedly over a longer period of time</strong>. This form of trauma mainly results from a child lacking the care of or trust in its primary caregiver from a very young age. </p>



<p>The outdated belief to let a baby cry itself to sleep is today known to be one critical factor for developmental trauma. Why? Because infants are neither able to self-regulate their nervous system, nor can they learn from such an experience. The <a href="https://books.google.at/books?id=TXCtN3GeSOwC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=trauma+is+in+the+nervous+system+not+the+event&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dnWXr9S-Bq&amp;sig=ACfU3U2W0yz6z0CtBX4qJT2GxSLb43nx-g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj0rZvem5_0AhUW77sIHQtrCSkQ6AF6BAgbEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=trauma%20is%20in%20the%20nervous%20system%20not%20the%20event&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">situation in the eyes of a child</a> is simply terrifying. It also adds a sense of overwhelming helplessness, since they have <strong>less inner resources to help themselves</strong> compared to an adult.</p>

<p>Developmental trauma is more common than shock trauma. Symptoms of developmental trauma often don&#8217;t seem obvious at first. They <em>can</em> but don&#8217;t necessarily include sleep disorders, restlessness, nervousness, anxiety, panic, volatility, self-mutilation, general exhaustion, lack of self-worth, fits of rage, panic, smoking, addiction and depression. But also a general inability to connect to the self and/or others in a healthy and sustainable way.</p>



<h3>Understanding Trauma</h3>



<p>The emphasis for the resulting symptoms lies on “can”. Even though these situations (both from shock and developmental trauma) <strong>hold the potential for trauma</strong>, some individuals seem to have developed more inner resources. These resources help them to work through overwhelming events and thus prevent trauma from manifesting in the first place.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Trauma is not what happens to you, 
<br>
it’s what happens inside you as a result of what happened to you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="quote-author">– Gabor Maté </p>
</div>



<p>An important part of comprehending trauma is to understand that <em>“trauma is not in the event itself; rather, trauma resides in the nervous system” </em>(Peter A. Levine) and thus is <strong>stuck in the body</strong>. <br>To say it in the words of trauma researcher <a href="https://humanwindow.com/dr-gabor-mate-interview-childhood-trauma-anxiety-culture/?fbclid=IwAR1g4N_rjvqv7EJyym_krRi1EzEum1xkZlyXjlKcev9bdQxtbkURVFBtA_I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gabor Maté</a>: <em>“Trauma is not what happens to you, it’s what happens inside you as a result of what happened to you.”</em></p>



<h2 id="3">1.2 Trauma and the Mind-Body Connection</h2>



<p>The origin of the word ‘trauma’ is Greek for ‘wound’. Trauma is a wound. A wound that, if not healed well, can create dysfunction and fear. As the body and the mind are inextricably connected, <strong>every emotional wound is represented in the physical body</strong>. Every physical wound will also affect our emotional and psychological state of being.</p>



<p>A simple example is our bodily response to a feeling of being rushed or hurried. The body increases the heart rate, blood pressure and breathing rate <strong>to be able to release more energy</strong>. Vice versa we can often observe that physically injured people behave more sensitive and might feel sad or more vulnerable.</p>



<p>More visible to the eye, physical trauma from cuts or fractures is stored in the body. This can be in the form of scar tissue or shortened ligaments. These types of wounds are commonly treated with physical therapy like physiotherapy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The often overlooked consequences of unresolved emotional trauma can also be found in the body. They are mostly <strong>identifiable through bodily sensations</strong>. </p>



<p>It is safe to say that almost everyone has already experienced sensations such as heartache, a wrenched gut, feeling constricted, tension or numbness at least once in their life. For traumatised individuals this feeling is not temporary but a constant companion which remains mainly untreated and undetected.</p>



<p>In conclusion, it is essential to know that <strong>all trauma is stored in the body</strong> and not only in the mind. Understanding this is key to understand and heal trauma. </p>

<p>Our body is like a <strong>map</strong> <strong>full of landmarks</strong> telling the story of our life. And the story of what has happened to us. The chapters of this story can be read in all the body&#8217;s tissues. This can be fascia, organs, muscle and ligaments. But also in form of the wiring of the nervous system and neural pathways which explains our behavioural patterns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taking this conclusion a step further, means that <strong>through</strong> <strong>changing the body</strong>, it is possible to ultimately <strong>change the mind</strong>. And thus being able to make decisions towards changing your life. Achieving this is not done by a flick of the finger, but rather by preparing yourself to take part in a (life)long journey. Yoga can be a great <strong>tool</strong> and act as a companion on this journey.</p>



<h2 id="4">1.3 The Importance of Working With Trauma in the Body</h2>



<p>Today, and especially in the West, it is common practice to treat trauma showing up in the mind or emotions at a psychologist or psychiatrist. Conversational and behavioural therapies and/or medication represent the majority of used therapies. Yet, the correspondent part of trauma residing in the body is often neglected. This is not to say that one should not be taking medication or go to talk therapy. </p>



<p>However as all trauma resides in the nervous system, it is <strong>key to soothe the nervous system´s arousal</strong> and alter its perception of danger to overcome trauma. The nervous system, consisting of the brain, the spinal cord and a myriad of nerves, is part of the body. So it is not only essential but also fairly accessible and easy to <strong>start releasing trauma by moving </strong>and changing the state of the body. </p>



<p>The central idea behind this approach is to aid the body release the energy which got stuck in the body during the overwhelming event.</p>



<p>Our body has four main stress responses &#8211; <strong>fight, flight, freeze and shut down</strong>. A healthy response enables us to act out and fully release energy afterwards. If this is not possible or suppressed, then this energy of shock and terror remains <strong>frozen</strong> inside of the body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is one example of a failed acting out of a stress response. It could be being unable to run away because of being strapped down for a medical procedure. On the other hand, a healthy release of energy could be by (involuntary) <strong>trembling, shaking or crying</strong>. The importance lays on nobody telling you to stop this or rate it as inappropriate behaviour.</p>

</div>



<p>Survivors of traumatic events often experience a disconnection or disassociation from their bodies or specific parts of the body. This is because the sensation in the body or in a certain body area is too unbearable to feel every day. The body suppresses the painful sensation and <strong>goes into protection mode</strong>, to enable us to survive our daily life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So in a way, it is a very helpful response, because our body is simply trying to protect us. This line of thought – that <strong>our body is actually helping us</strong> and not working against us – is a very central aspect of acknowledging trauma. And the first step towards healing it.</p>



<p>The good news is, that somatic (body-centered) visionaries and bodyworkers, such as Ida Rolf, Peter Levine and Moshe Feldenkrais, have developed some very effective ways of transcending trauma. This is by working with the physical body. These include Somatic ExperiencingⓇ and TREⓇ (Tension and Trauma Releasing Exercises) and others. Also, <strong>regular yoga practice</strong> in general, as well as trauma informed yoga approaches can be helpful.</p>

<h1 id="5">2. Why Yoga Is So Effective for Healing Trauma</h1>



<p></p>



<p>Bessel van der Kolk, trauma researcher and author of the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693771-the-body-keeps-the-score" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“The Body Keeps the Score”</a>, has conducted empirical <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25004196/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a> which show that <strong>yoga is significantly more effective</strong> than medication or psychotherapy to relieve symptoms of PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and many other trauma symptoms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main reason for this lies in the soothing effect of yoga on the nervous system and the body. Further effects can be found in the altered state of the mind and self-perception.</p>

<p>Next we will dive into the details of the positive effects of yoga on trauma. But before we start it is important to <strong>understand what traumatized individuals may struggle with</strong> during a yoga class. This is the basis to hold space and empathy for arising feelings. It also enables us to give options accordingly or to make more sense of your own reaction in certain situations.</p>



<p>We will cover more tips on teaching trauma sensitive yoga. So keep your eyes open for our upcoming article on yoga and trauma.</p>



<h2 id="6">2.1 Possible Challenges for a Traumatised Person During a Yoga Practice</h2>



<p>As each human being is highly individual, so are trauma responses. The following list is by no means exhaustive, but intends to give you a first idea about what to expect.</p>



<p>In a yoga class individuals with a history of trauma <em>may</em> feel:<br></p>



<ul><li>That they have difficulty with closing their eyes, as they <strong>don’t feel safe</strong> enough.&nbsp;<br></li><li>They cannot hold certain poses for too long because of <strong>unwelcome pain, thoughts, feelings</strong> or other body sensations rising up.<br></li><li>Being unable to access a certain body part because they<strong> don&#8217;t know “where it is”</strong> on a sensory level. This could be resulting from numbness in the body.<br></li><li>They have difficulty breathing calmly and deeply. This can be due to the <strong>breath is shallow </strong>and restless and focusing on the breath might create anxiety.<br></li><li>Sitting or laying still in quietness with their own thoughts is not easy or can be frightening.<br></li><li>They cannot feel “common/normal” sensations. For example the sensation of opening up in backbends, because of <strong>feeling constricted and tense</strong> in their body.</li></ul>



<p>As said before, these are only a snapshot of challenges that may arise during a yoga class. The reason for these challenges lies mainly in the constant firing of the nervous system in survival mode. Thus leading to a subconscious but highly alert feeling of perceived danger. </p>

<p><strong>Understanding the nervous system</strong> and how to reprogram the conditions above is explained in the concept of the Polyvagal Theory. It will be the topic of the third article in this series on trauma and yoga.</p>



<h2 id="7">2.2 Positive Effects of Yoga for Healing Trauma</h2>



<p>A short word on yoga. When most people think about yoga, they think about <em>asana</em> and <a href="https://tools.tintyoga.com/">yoga sequences</a>. And most commonly even about pretzeling their bodies into strange shapes. But this only relates to the physical aspect of the practice.</p>



<p>But <strong>yoga is so much more than just asana</strong>, as it includes <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/pranayama-an-intro-to-the-power-of-yogic-breathing/">breath practice</a> (<em>pranayama</em>), <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/meditation-and-awareness-as-tools-to-explore-the-mind/">meditation</a> (<em>dhyana</em>) and <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/yoga-meditation-a-practice-of-mindfulness/">mindfulness</a> techniques, self-study, ethical principles and even specific cleansing protocols.</p>



<p>The earlier mentioned <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263739375_Yoga_as_an_Adjunctive_Treatment_for_Posttraumatic_Stress_Disorder_A_Randomized_Controlled_Trial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> from Dr. van der Kolk describes the <strong>healing effects of yoga for trauma</strong> as follows: “<em>Yoga may improve the functioning of traumatized individuals by helping them to tolerate physical and sensory experiences associated with fear and helplessness and to increase emotional awareness and affect tolerance.</em>”</p>



<p></p>



<p>But what does that exactly mean?</p>



<p>Simply put, yoga helps to:</p>



<ul><li>Sit and stay in a body position with feelings coming up, but also finding a specific end to it. This reestablishes a sense of time and a <strong>feeling of “this too shall pass”.</strong> It will make the experience predictable and thus add safety.<br></li><li>Move the body according to a specific structure of asanas. This can help to find guidance but also <strong>set boundaries</strong> and a frame for experiencing the body. The body can be experienced as a container with a capacity for holding all kinds of feelings.<br></li><li>Learn how to <strong>use the breath</strong> as an agent of calmness and equanimity. This adds a different quality to the nervous system.<br></li><li>Reflect upon and reframe one&#8217;s personal story by <strong>using mindfulness techniques</strong>.<br></li><li><strong>Change the structure of the connective tissue</strong> through sustained stretches. In contrast to general exercise regimens, yoga can change the pattern of the fascia and, related to this, the patterns of emotions.<br></li><li>Develop a deep relationship to the inner sensory system and thus <strong>reconnect to the body</strong>.<br></li><li>Add new layers of growth, confidence and triumph through mastering new skills. This is immensely effective to <strong>change the perspective</strong> of being in the role of the victim.<br></li><li>Safely experience deep states of relaxation, like <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/savasana/">Savasana</a> or Yoga Nidra, helping to <strong>soothe the nervous system</strong>.</li></ul>



<p>You can watch Dr. van der Kolk beautifully explaining the effects of yoga in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmKfzbHzm_s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">short video</a>. Yet another positive effect of yoga is the general organic and fluid movement which releases stuck energy in the tissue. It helps to increase circulation to open the tissue up for new experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/why-music-is-important/">Playing music</a> during a yoga class can also help to fully immerse in the movement and experience a sense of feeling alive.</p>





<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="8">2.3 Best Yoga Styles for Trauma Release</h2>



<p>When it comes to yoga styles, there is really not one preferred over another. Rather there are different aspects of each practice to be considered depending on <strong>what you wish the outcome to be</strong>.</p>



<p>More static and therapeutic yoga styles, like Iyengar yoga, can greatly help to support the body. Mostly the positions are held for around ninety seconds. As the muscles have a chance to calm down, the much slower moving fascia can also begin to <strong>relax and lengthen</strong>.</p>



<p>However, more dynamic styles like Vinyasa or Ashtanga Yoga can help to <strong>increase the body temperature</strong> and internal heat. You can imagine stuckness in the body like a kind of mucus or glue. Heating it up will make it easier to move it through the body. This can also have a positive effect on the overall quality of the fascia.</p>



<p>Often specific forms of yoga like Kundalini Yoga or Osho meditation can be helpful for releasing trauma. They involve a lot of <strong>shaking and repetitive, meditative movements</strong>. The shaking helps to free up the frozen trauma energy.</p>

</div>



<p>Gentle practices like <a href="https://tools.tintyoga.com/">calm sequences</a> of <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/yin-yoga-poses/">Yin Yoga</a> can be used to encounter the issues of trauma in the deeper tissue layers. By encouraging longer holds, experiences of upcoming emotions can be supported. Simultaneously Yin Yoga is very calming for the nervous system in general.</p>

</div>



<p>Whichever style you pick for yourself, be aware of very enduring practices which demand you to push past your boundaries. Exceeding your tolerable capacity can become counterproductive, as sudden and big releases can hold the potential to re-traumatise. </p>



<p>It is always important to<strong> let the traumatic energy surface slowly</strong> and in small quantities. This is even more true for more overwhelm that has been experienced. So always be gentle to yourself.</p>



<p>Further ways for creative energy output can be found in activities such as theater roleplaying, dancing or play in general. The idea behind this is to change the story and <strong>experience yourself in new ways</strong>.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;If the body feels safe, the mind feels safe.&#8221;</p>
<p class="quote-author">– Bessel van der Kolk </p>
</div>



<p>However, this change will not happen in a day or in a month. It will require a <a href="https://tintyoga.com/purpose/">long term commitment</a> – to yourself and to your healing journey.</p>



<p>Different people need different things, there is no “one size fits all” and life is an experiment. So is healing trauma: It is an experiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the end, it is all about finding a way to acknowledge that what has happened to you is over. And to find a feeling of safety in your body, because if the body feels safe, the mind feels safe.</p>

<p class="intro-text">Maybe you remember <strong>keeping a journal</strong> throughout your teenage years – mainly to express your feelings about your most recent crush or the fight with your best friend. Perhaps that was the last time that you put pen to paper and expressed your dreams and thoughts.</p>



<p>However, even as an adult, you can <strong>benefit tremendously from journaling</strong> regularly as it is a powerful tool to reflect on daily experiences, relationships, and personal values. Thus, it can help you to better get in touch with yourself and your thoughts and feelings.</p>

<h2 id="1">1. How to Write a Journal</h2>



<p>The first step is always the most difficult one. You may be reluctant to (re)establish such a seemingly childish routine. However, as we will see throughout this article, <strong>journaling can have various positive impacts</strong> on your mental health, cognitive performance, creativity, and resilience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first step is, of course, to gather some sheets of paper or buy a notebook, get a pen ready, and start writing. But let’s take a deeper look into <strong>what journaling is</strong> to get you started more easily.</p>



<h3>1.1. What Is a Journal?</h3>



<p>This is often the first question you may ask yourself as an aspiring journal writer. You might even seek guidance in books, blogs (you’ve come to the right place), or other resources.</p>



<p>The thing is: <strong>There is no right or wrong </strong>when it comes to journaling. In general, as long as you write down what’s in your head, you’re on the right path.</p>



<p>However, there certainly are <strong>different methods and approaches</strong> to journaling that may help you find a clearer direction when writing.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Morning Pages</h4>



<p>One example are the so-called morning pages. This means that you fill a certain number of pages with whatever comes to your mind <strong>first thing in the morning</strong>. </p>



<p>You could start with three to four pages of longhand <strong>stream-of-consciousness writing</strong> as soon as you wake up. This means that you simply write down anything that comes to mind. Don’t stop, revise, rephrase or correct your writing. Imagine your pen pulling your thoughts directly out of your head and onto the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The important thing is to remember that your writings are not meant to be art and you don’t have to show them to anybody. They don’t need to be smart, funny, or particularly deep. In fact, it’s best to <strong>free yourself from any expectations</strong> as to these first pages in the morning.</p>



<p>Of course, you can also journal any other time of the day. Consider it<strong> a sort of brain drain</strong> and a way to let go of all the – if any – angry, sad, troublesome, and seemingly unimportant stuff in your head. It’s a great way to release everything that whirls through your subconscious and troubles you throughout the day. This will feel like a huge relief.</p>

<h4>Journal Prompts</h4>



<p>If you’d prefer a more conventional journaling style, <strong>set a specific topic </strong>before you start writing and pursue it. This differs from morning pages – where you do not set a topic – in that you’re not jumping from one topic to another. You rather focus on gathering insights and directions for a specific purpose.</p>



<p>Your <strong>journal topics</strong> can range from love and relationships, work and career to self-reflection and personal goals. You can also <strong>ask yourself a specific journal question</strong> before you start writing. </p>



<p>If you want to explore <strong>love and relationships</strong>, ask yourself:</p>



<ul><li>Who do I trust and why?</li><li>What is important to me in a relationship?</li><li>What do I value most in my relationships?</li></ul>



<p>If you rather want to explore your <strong>work and career life</strong>, these questions may help you:</p>



<ul><li>Which part of my work do I enjoy the most?</li><li>What are my strengths and abilities in my job?</li><li>What are my professional goals?</li></ul>



<p>If you want to focus on <strong>self-reflection and growth</strong>, ask yourself the following questions:</p>



<ul><li>What values do I consider most important in life and how do I act accordingly?</li><li>What do I appreciate most about myself? Which aspects do I find hard to accept?</li><li>What changes can I make to my life to make it 1% better today?</li></ul>



<p>Of course, there are more journal prompts, topics, and questions that you can write about. There are indefinite possibilities. The important thing here is that you pick the first one that appeals to you and get started.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Therapeutic Journaling</h4>



<p>You can even use journaling as a tool to <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/overcoming-trauma-through-yoga/">overcome trauma</a>. A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1997-05130-000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study by J.W. Pennebaker</a> found that journaling about traumatic experiences or difficult situations specifically has the most <strong>significant impact on your mental well-being</strong>. They even found that writing about your problems can improve your health since long-buried trauma decreases the functionality of the immune system.</p>



<p>In this study, participants were randomly instructed to write about either traumatic experiences or superficial topics for a period of four days. Six weeks later, participants that wrote about traumatic experiences were able to <strong>report a more positive mood </strong>and suffered less often from illnesses than those who wrote about everyday experiences.</p>



<h4>Bullet Journal</h4>



<p>If you’re a very creative person, a <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bullet journal</a> is perfect for you. Rather than just writing down your thoughts and filling the pages one after another, you can use drawings, symbols, mind maps, and other visualizations to <strong>bring your thoughts to life on paper</strong>. Also, you jump in between pages as you have dedicated sections for different topics such as long-term goals, watch lists, bucket lists, habit trackers, etc. The more, the merrier!</p>



<p>So, as you can see, <strong>a journal can be as individual as the writer</strong>. You can even write your journal in digital form, using a word processor or an app. Follow your intuition and use what feels best for you.&nbsp;</p>





<h2>1.2. How Do I Set Up a Journaling Routine?</h2>



<p>Although there are no strict rules when it comes to journaling, <strong>developing a routine</strong> – in any area of your life – has <a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/health-benefits-of-having-a-routine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">positive effects</a> on your mental and overall health. This is because developing habits reduces stress and anxiety as it gives you more time and energy for other activities and more time to relax.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same goes for journaling: Writing every day allows you to connect with yourself and increase your self-awareness <strong>on a daily basis</strong>. Instead of accumulating stress and negative thoughts over a longer period of time, writing them down instantly enables you to let go of these thoughts and feelings, giving you more space for happier and healthier emotions.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>21-Day Rule</h4>



<p>To set up a journaling routine, commit to writing every day<strong> for at least 21 days in a row</strong>. This period of time is generally considered to be required in order to <a href="https://jamesclear.com/new-habit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">form a new habit</a>. For starters, you don’t need to write more than five minutes or until you’ve filled one page. Set the boundaries low so you’re more likely to achieve them. This will also motivate you to keep going.</p>



<h4>Set a Reminder</h4>



<p>You can even <strong>set a reminder on your smartphone</strong> at the same time every day. This way, you will feel more obliged to pursue your newly-required routine on a daily basis. I mean, who can resist the notification on a smartphone?</p>



<h4>Buy a Notebook</h4>



<p>To make the start even easier, you could buy a <strong>beautifully handcrafted notebook</strong>, a new pen, and ink. This will encourage you to use it more often and sets you in a positive mood as soon as you reach for your notebook.</p>



<h4>Get Comfortable</h4>



<p>Also, create an agreeable environment for your journaling routine. Maybe you want to sit down in your favorite spot with a hot beverage of your choice. You can even light some candles or play some soothing music to get you in the right mood. Whatever helps you to <strong>feel comfortable and secure</strong> will also boost your motivation for your writing.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Don’t Overthink It</h4>



<p>And lastly: Don’t think about what you’re going to write or whether this will be meaningful and sophisticated output. <strong>Just write.</strong> And if you don’t know what to write, start with: “I don’t know what to write, but…”. You’ll see, after some initial difficulties, your pen will almost fly on its own over the pages.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>1.3. Do I Have to Journal Daily?</h3>



<p>All conviction about routines and habits aside: If journaling every day is not your thing, engage in this activity as regularly as it feels right for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Expressive writing, for example, is typically done for four consecutive days. While this is only a recommendation, <strong>there is no one-size-fits-all</strong>. Whether you want to journal several days in a row, a few times a week, or just once a week. You can write for 5 or for 20 minutes (or even longer if you’re really in a flow!). You can write about the same topic every day or change the subject even several times in one entry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The above-mentioned research by Dr. Pennebaker even found that a one-time session of 15 to 30 minutes of journaling can already have benefits. The thing is that <strong>writing too much and too often</strong>, especially when you experience a lot of negative thoughts, can even lead you into a trap of destructive self-talk. And that certainly is not what you want to achieve with journaling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rather think of <strong>writing as an expressive task</strong> and a kind of course correction instead of another stressful commitment that you load on yourself for the rest of your life.</p>



<p>Especially if you feel highly disturbed and troubled, <strong>take a break from journaling</strong> for a couple of days. When you come back to your routine, write about what you experienced during these last days. And if you don’t find any comfort in writing or have the impression that it even makes things worse, look for another outlet. Try out a new sport, a new hobby, or talk to someone – maybe even a therapist. </p>



<p>Yoga can also be a great outlet for any type of feelings. Particularly in Inside Flow, the music reaches the hearts of the yogis and yoginis, but also any type of <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/overcoming-trauma-through-yoga/">trauma-informed yoga</a> can be very emotional. You might also want to put your thoughts and feelings into building your own unique yoga sequence with our free <a href="https://tools.tintyoga.com/">Yoga Sequence Builder </a>tool. </p>



<h3>1.4. Can Journaling Be Bad for You?</h3>



<p>Before we look at the numerous benefits of journaling, we should not forget that there may be times and situations where this may not apply. Sometimes, writing down your thoughts <strong>can have negative effects</strong> on your emotions and feelings and, consequently, also on your behavior and overall well-being.</p>



<p>Yes, you read it right: Journaling can also have negative effects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1207/S15324796ABM2403_10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2002 study</a> suggests that journaling about stressful events only bears the risk of hashing and rehashing the same problems and difficulties over and over again.</p>



<p>If you <strong>live too much in your head</strong>, you risk becoming a passive observer of your life rather than an active participant. If you think too much about how you’ll write down your life, you might miss actually experiencing what is happening around you and forget to live in the moment.</p>



<p>Journaling more often than would do you good can also make you become self-obsessed and encourage you to <strong>wallow in negative things and self-pity</strong>. This way, journaling can even become a vehicle of blame instead of a solution finder.</p>





<h2 id="2">2. The Benefits of Journaling</h2>



<p>Despite the concerns and obstacles you may face during journaling, it’s well worth the effort! Let’s look at the most important benefits of journaling.</p>



<h3>2.1.&nbsp; Easy and Flexible</h3>



<p>Journaling can be used to <strong>reflect on any issues in your life</strong>. It is adjustable to meet the needs, style, and processing methods of everyone and even is doable for both left and right-brained people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As it has no set rules, <strong>there’s even room for messiness, typos, and not quite perfect writing skills</strong>. With some patience, also persons with a reading and writing weakness can engage in regular writing and may find comfort in it. This is especially true if you choose to keep a bullet journal as it also allows for drawings and other creative ways to put your thoughts on paper.</p>



<p>Scribbling into a journal takes as little time as you can spare or as much time as you want to spare. It’s a great opportunity to <strong>stop, pay attention and listen to yourself</strong>. Journaling is often self-starting and motivating and, thus, supplies its own energy.</p>



<h3>2.2. Teaches You to Get to Know Yourself Better</h3>



<p>Journaling does not only help you to build self-confidence and self-knowledge, it also helps you to<strong> feel better about yourself</strong> and to identify your core values. It’s a great possibility to learn to read your own mind.</p>



<p>As you shift to the observer of your own behavior, <strong>journaling is a process of self-discovery</strong>. It allows you to reveal your thinking patterns as well as your learning and creation processes. It’s a great way to clarify your own thoughts, feelings, and behavior as well as to create awareness of your inner beliefs and opinions, enabling you to proactively change them.</p>



<p>Your journal may even <strong>reveal different aspects of yourself</strong> and ​​allow you to access the unconscious, subconscious, and super-conscious. As such, noting down your experiences also aids in connecting causes to effects and may even enable you to find the missing pieces and the unsaid.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>2.3. Increases Creativity and Intuition</h3>



<p>Writing into a journal <strong>increases your self-trust </strong>and helps you awaken your inner voice (or rather learn to hear it again). It provides insights into your creative and intuitive mind and gives you a clear understanding of your intentions and innermost beliefs.</p>



<p>Apart from that, <strong>journaling improves your sensitivity </strong>toward your own feelings and thought processes. In consequence, it can boost your creativity, increase your memory, and may even help you interpret symbols and dreams.</p>



<h3>2.4. Facilitates Problem-Solving and Decision-Making</h3>



<p>As you become the <strong>detective of your own thought processes</strong>, journaling helps you make decisions and offers new perspectives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also is a great way to <strong>get a bigger picture </strong>of certain situations as it brings things together and shows relations and connections in their entirety instead of separately.</p>



<p>Writing into a journal helps you to <strong>focus and identify your true desires and needs</strong>. As a result, it enables you to move towards wholeness and growth and to discover who you really are. You may even be able to explore your spirituality and integrity. This allows freedom of expression and makes it easier for you to make decisions that are in line with your true self.</p>



<p>You also learn to shift your focus from a problem-focused to a solution-oriented mindset.&nbsp;</p>

</div>



<h3>2.5. Helps to Reduce Stress and Feel Mentally Stable</h3>



<p>Journaling helps <strong>control your stress level</strong> and improve your mood as it helps you prioritize problems, fears, and concerns.</p>



<p>If you track symptoms of stress and mental or physical fatigue on a daily basis, you can <strong>recognize triggers </strong>and discover ways and possibilities to better respond to them.</p>



<p>If you’re willing, journaling also provides you an <strong>opportunity for positive self-talk </strong>and identifying negative thoughts and behaviors as well as any factors that cause stress or anxiety. Once you’ve identified these stressors, you can make a conscious effort to resolve these problems and reduce stress and anxiety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will bring you <strong>mental stability </strong>and increase your mental and emotional well-being. As a result, you become more resilient to the various challenges life may throw at you.</p>



<h3>2.6. Fosters Personal Growth</h3>



<p>Summarizing all the benefits mentioned above, journaling helps you to <strong>live your life to the fullest</strong>, express yourself freely, and know your inner values. As such, it is one of the most effective ways to foster personal growth and discover your true potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you measure and track what’s important, you will see more results in your personal, professional, and spiritual life.&nbsp;</p>





<h2 id="3">3. WRITE to Start Journaling</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://journaltherapy.com/lets-journal/a-short-course-in-journal-writing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Journal Therapy</a> (yes, there really is such a thing!) has developed a short guideline of 5 steps that help you get in the journaling mood. And it’s fairly easy to remember: just <strong>W-R-I-T-E</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>W – What topic?</strong> What do you want to write about? What’s going on in your head? How do you feel? Name the first thing that comes into your mind. Any topic is great.</p>



<p><strong>R – Reflect on it.</strong> Start writing by beginning your sentence with “I feel…” or “I want…” or “Today I want/I feel/I wish…”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>I – Investigate.</strong> Explore your thoughts and feelings further. The best way to do this is to simply keep writing. Remember: There’s no right or wrong. As long as your pen moves across the page, you’re doing a great job. If you’re stuck, close your eyes for a moment. Re-read your text and resume writing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>T – Time yourself.</strong> It’s recommended to write for a specified amount of time. If you’re new to journaling, don’t set the threshold too high. Start with 5 to 15 minutes and commit to writing for at least that amount of time. You can always write longer if you feel like it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>E – Exit smart.</strong> Re-read what you’ve written and end with a short summary. Adding a final sentence that starts with something like “As I read this, I feel/think/hope…” helps you to clarify any action steps or identify take-aways.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="intro-text">When it comes to <strong>the final relaxation Savasana</strong>&nbsp; – also spelled Shavasana – many yoga teachers experience the same: It doesn’t matter how early the class starts and whether the class ends on time, there will always be one or two students who leave before Savasana.</p>



<p>And it may seem like a smart idea to skip the final 10 minutes of class to get in the shower before everyone else or to head out of the studio before the big rush starts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, most yoga teachers say that <strong>Savasana is the most important pose </strong>of the yoga class and should never be skipped. But is that true? What does Savasana mean? Why do we actually practice Savasana? And what different possibilities are there for your final relaxation?</p>

</div>



<h1 id="1">1. What is Savasana?</h1>



<h2>1.1. The Meaning of Savasana&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Savasana – or Shavasana – is the <strong>final relaxation pose </strong>usually practiced at the <a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/yoga-cool-down">end of a yoga class</a>. It probably is the first Sanskrit word learned by yoga students – and is often the only one they can remember.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what does Savasana actually mean? The word can be broken down into its two parts: <em>sava</em> meaning “corpse” and <em>asana</em> meaning “posture”. Hence its <strong>English name Corpse pose</strong>.</p>



<p>The name refers to the <strong>state of calmness, rest, and relaxation</strong> that is the aim of this pose. Sometimes, this can even mean drifting away or napping when the well-exercised body and relaxed mind settle into the mat at the end of the yoga practice.</p>



<p>To practice Corpse pose, close your eyes and breathe naturally. Allow this final relaxation asana to eliminate tension from the body. Ideally, you stay there for <strong>10 to 20 minutes</strong>. However, even a few minutes of Savasana are better than nothing and can already have tremendous benefits.</p>



<p>Although Savasana might look like a nap at the end of the yoga practice, it actually is <strong>a fully conscious pose </strong>aimed at being awake, yet completely relaxed. Lying down on the back and relaxing body and mind allows yoga practitioners to fully assimilate the benefits of the asana practice.</p>



<h2>1.2. Why Savasana Is the Hardest Yoga Pose</h2>



<p>The complete stillness in mind and body makes Savasana for many people the easiest pose physically, but at the same time, the most challenging pose mentally and/or emotionally. Maybe that’s why <strong>some yoga students are so tempted to skip Savasana</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, this final relaxation pose is intended to gradually relax one body part at a time, one muscle at a time, and one thought at a time. Practiced constantly over a longer period of time, relaxing in Corpse pose conditions the body to <a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/yoga-for-stress-relief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release stress</a>.</p>



<p>However, many yoga practitioners have well exercised their bodies – as well as in their minds. This makes relaxing — even when you lie down — <strong>a seemingly impossible task</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, it’s important to practice the more active asanas before attempting Savasana as they help the body to stretch and release tension in the muscles. Apart from that, the active asana practice helps relax the diaphragm to allow the breath to move freely.</p>



<p>But here’s the thing: Even if your body is able to calm down, <strong>your mind may do quite the opposite</strong>. Suddenly, when you’re completely motionless on your mat, the thoughts in your head seem to whirl around like crazy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may find yourself thinking:</p>



<ul><li>Did I close the window at home?</li><li>What should I cook for dinner?</li><li>I have to send that email later.</li><li>Did I just snore?</li><li>I can’t get that song out of my head.</li><li>What time is it?</li><li>I hope I’ll catch the bus afterward.</li><li>Should I put my socks on?</li></ul>



<p>Sounds familiar to you? Don’t worry. It’s totally normal for your mind to try to resist that state of deep relaxation. Savasana is the <strong>ultimate act of conscious surrender</strong> – and that it takes time and practice to learn to surrender.</p>





<h1 id="2">2. Why Do We Practice Savasana?</h1>



<p>The main purpose of Savasana is to <strong>calm down the mind</strong>. While it is true that physical strain and engagement are great ways to calm down, ending a yoga class in Corpse pose is the most direct way to relax.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main tools used for this purpose are <strong>breath and awareness</strong>. The breath plays a crucial role for our mind and body. By consciously extending exhalation, for example, we can activate the parasympathetic nervous system, i.e. the part of our nervous system that is responsible for switching from the fight-or-flight mode into the rest-and-digest mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second element to calm down our mind is awareness. Our <strong>cognitive system</strong> is usually busy with reflecting, decision-making and planning. When we’re in these thought processes, we usually neglect awareness and mindfulness. </p>



<p>Savasana can be used to consciously extend cognitive thought processes that <strong>focus on feeling and experiencing</strong>. This includes body scans, progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), traditional savasana meditations, and Yinvasana, which is a combination of Yin yoga and Savasana. These are just a few among many methods to focus on consciously experiencing – and thus enjoying – the present moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, one common misconception about Savasana is that it is always practiced in the same way. The truth is that <strong>it can be done in various ways</strong>. In his series <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/programs/calm-down-with-shavasana">Calm Down with Shavasana</a>, TINT Instructor <a href="https://tintyoga.com/instructors/hie-kim">Hie Kim</a> shows you how multifaceted the world of Savasana can be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He has put together a colorful collection of <strong>beautiful Shavasana sequences</strong> for you, which will give you the chance to find balance amidst the stress of everyday life.</p>

<h2>2.1. The Benefits of Savasana&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Since our world is moving so quickly, giving your body and mind a break in Savasana is a very valuable practice. While our society places more and more emphasis on speed and productivity, learning how to relax actually helps you <strong>become more productive</strong>.</p>



<p>Regular practice of Savasana will help you <strong>train your ability to relax</strong>. This is not only an essential quality for meditation but it also completes the true yoga experience. Releasing your physical body in Corpse pose may even enable you to discover another part of yourself that is light and free.</p>



<p>In addition, Savasana helps to <strong>balance our nervous system</strong>: while the asana practice is mostly designed to stimulate the body and even provide healthy stress, Savasana is the counterpart. It shifts the activity away from the sympathetic nervous system (responsible for our flight-or-fight reaction) to the parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) mode.</p>



<p>This is very important because a state of hyperstimulation creates <a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/stress/health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stress</a> that can even lead to anxiety, fatigue, high blood pressure, and impact the immune system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over time, Savasana teaches us to move from anxiety and hyper-stimulation to this state of down-regulation where digestion, the immune system, and other essential systems of <strong>the body can recalibrate and reset </strong>in order to work unimpededly and efficiently.</p>



<p>As you can see, the <strong>benefits of Savasana</strong>, or Corpse pose, are numerous and include (but are not limited to):</p>



<ul><li>Teaching muscles to release and, thus, reducing muscular tension;</li><li>Activating the parasympathetic nervous system and its relaxation response;</li><li>Reinforcing and integrating the experience of the preceding yoga class;</li><li>Increasing heart rate variability and, thus, resilience;</li><li>Lowering blood pressure and slowing down the heart rate;</li><li>Promoting better sleep;</li><li>Supporting immune system functionality;</li></ul>



<p>and many more.&nbsp;</p>





<h2>2.2. Six Tips for a Successful Savasana</h2>



<p>Not every Savasana is the same. One day your mind is more restless than on the next day. Sometimes, you have no problem emptying your mind and sometimes it just feels impossible to do it at all.</p>



<p>The trick is to <strong>not put too much pressure</strong> on yourself to stay focused. Here are <strong>six tips</strong> on how you can get the most out of your final relaxation.</p>



<h3>Tip #1: Make Yourself Comfortable</h3>



<p>Stretch out on your mat and make yourself really comfortable. If you want, you can even <strong>use bolsters, pillows, and blankets</strong> to find a relaxing position. You can also cover your eyes with an eye pillow or towel to help you withdraw your senses from the outside world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more comfortable you are, the more easily you can surrender. The more you surrender, the more relaxed you will become. And the more relaxed you are, the greater the benefits of your Savasana.</p>



<h3>Tip #2: Exhale Completely</h3>



<p>Exhaling completely and audibly – maybe even with a sigh – signals to your body to <strong>let go and release</strong> into the pose. Therefore, this relieving breath also tells your parasympathetic nervous system to relax as you are safe and can just be as you are.</p>



<h3>Tip #3: Scan Your Body&nbsp;</h3>



<p>If you’re having trouble centering yourself, <strong>bring your awareness into your body</strong> by scanning it from bottom to top. Run through every single part of your body and check in with each individual muscle and limb to make sure that you don’t hold tension anywhere.</p>



<p>Be particularly aware of possible tension hiding in the jaw, forehead, temples, and shoulders.</p>



<h3>Tip #4: Let Go</h3>



<p>Close your eyes – both physically and mentally. With every breath, sink a little bit deeper into your yoga mat.</p>



<p>Some days, this will be easier than others, but that’s part of the practice. However restless your mind might be, s<strong>tay still and at ease</strong>. Simply trust that the breath will carry you to the next moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maybe, you even want to <strong>visualize</strong> how the earth beneath you supports you or how your body heavily sinks into the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, you will find some <strong>peaceful moments of quietness</strong> between your buzzing thoughts. Over time, these moments will become longer and more frequent, helping you to find more inner peace.</p>



<h3>Tip #5: Be Patient With Yourself&nbsp;</h3>



<p>We’ve all been there at least once: We fell asleep during Savasana. Note, however, that <strong>the final relaxation is not a time to sleep</strong>. If you have a tendency to fall asleep, this actually is a sign of over-exhaustion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this case, the first step is to <strong>be compassionate with yourself</strong>. Acknowledge that your body needed some rest. Next time, make a conscious effort to stay awake. You could do this, for example, by connecting your awareness to one specific part of your body. Over time, you will be able to rest and release without falling asleep.</p>



<h3>Tip #6: Adjust Yourself</h3>



<p>You can make your Savasana even more enjoyable by bringing your body into the perfect position. To do so, <strong>lengthen your neck </strong>and lift the chin slightly. You want your neck to be wrinkle-free. This helps you to breathe better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, instead of just letting your feet fall outside, lift up one leg after another, lift up the buttock and inwardly rotate the thigh. Then, lengthen your leg before you let it drop to the ground again. This way, the legs will still fall outside, but you will have <strong>more space in your lower back</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apply the same actions to the <strong>shoulders and arms</strong>: Lift up one after the other, push the shoulder slightly outward and up. Internally rotate the arm and let it fall down on the mat. This gives you more space to breathe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And here’s an extra tip: Give your Savasana <strong>the same attention you would give to any other pose </strong>– say <a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/downward-facing-dog-alignment">Downward-Facing Dog</a>. If you continue to practice releasing tension and surrendering on the mat, it will become easier with time – just like any other pose gets easier with practice.</p>

<h1 id="3">3. Five Alternative Ways of Practicing Savasana</h1>



<p>There is no one-size-fits-all Savasana. So, the final relaxation part at the end of a yoga class can be as individual as the yoga teachers and students are. Here are some ideas on how you can bring some variety to your Savasana.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>3.1. Guided Savasana</h2>



<p>As most students will have trouble <a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/quietening-our-thougths-through-meditation/">calming their minds</a> with nothing to focus on but their<strong> own body and breath</strong>, a great way to facilitate relaxation is a guided Savasana. This can include anything from breathing instructions, body-scan guidance, Yoga Nidra, or progressive muscle relaxation (PMR).</p>



<p>The general intention is to aid the mind to stay alert by giving it an object of observation.</p>



<p>In Hie Kim’s series “Calm Down With Savasana”, you’ll find four guided Savasana sessions each with a different focus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A great and quite <strong>easily accessible way is a body scan </strong>where you run your awareness through the entire body, focusing on individual parts of the body. In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL3U65JZOMk&amp;t=1s">5-Minute Body Journey</a>, Hie Kim gives you an idea of how to guide a body scan as an alternative to Savasana.</p>

<h2>3.2. Savasana Meditation</h2>



<p><a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/yoga-meditation-a-practice-of-mindfulness/">Meditation</a> is a helpful tool to calm down the mind, reduce stress and anxiety, and promote well-being by <strong>activating the parasympathetic nervous system</strong>. Brain scans even showed that yoga and meditation can reduce the volume of the amygdala – our fear center located in the brain – on the right-hand side of the brain, which is more related to negative emotions such as anxiety. Researchers found that a consistent meditation practice can reduce fear-related amygdala activity.</p>



<p>As it has almost the same goals as the final relaxation in Corpse pose, <strong>meditation is a great alternative </strong>to lying flat on the back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is, while meditation is usually practiced in a <a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/meditation-sitting-position">seated position</a>, you can also lie down on the floor. However, this makes it harder to resist the temptation to fall asleep.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his Savasana series, Hie Kim provides you with two meditation sessions that can be practiced as an alternative to the traditional Savasana: A <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/programs/lunar-meditation-left-nostril-pranayama">lunar meditation</a> and a <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/programs/solar-meditation-right-nostril-pranayama">solar meditation</a> that help you change your energy level, depending on whether you want to up-scale or down-regulate your energy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>3.3. Savasana Readings &amp; Poems&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If you’re a <a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/successful-yoga-teacher">yoga teacher</a>, a very special treat to <strong>win the hearts of your yoga students</strong> is by amplifying their final relaxation part with a poem or a little story. Of course, this should not be just any story. Ideally, you give them some food for thought or some comforting words to promote kindness and mindfulness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To get some inspiration on what to read to your students in Savasana, check out Hie Kim’s Savasana poems <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/programs/shavasana-poem-connection">Connection</a> and <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/programs/shavasana-poem-blackout">Black Out</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, you can also read your own poems or inspirational stories and poetry you can find in books or on the internet. However, <strong>check the atmosphere in the yoga room </strong>first to get a feeling of whether your students are open to this.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>3.4. Savasana &amp; Pranayama</h2>



<p>The breath is the only part of the vegetative nervous system that we can consciously control. As such, it allows us to access anything that usually lies beyond our control. Therefore, <strong>the breath is the most important internal tool</strong> that we can use to calm down our system. By using all our respiratory muscles, we can easily prolong the breath cycle and, thus, signal our body to calm down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why breathing exercises – called <a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/pranayama-an-intro-to-the-power-of-yogic-breathing/">Pranayama</a> – are a great tool to enhance the benefits of Savasana. Experience the relaxing effect of Pranayama in Hie Kim’s <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/programs/the-3-phases-of-breath">3 Phases of Breath</a> or <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/programs/7-second-breath-6-min-pranayama">7-Second Breath</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>3.5. Yinvasana&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Yinvasana is a combination of <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/yin-yoga-poses">Yin yoga</a> and Savasana that can be practiced at the end of a yoga class. The slow and conscious movements help you to create a <strong>deep body-and-mind connection </strong>and release any remaining tension from the body. So, this is a great way to promote relaxation and let go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also create <strong>a very slow vinyasa flow</strong> with simple, repetitive movements to create a zen-like state of mind. This way, movement and breath are connected in one of the simplest, yet most beautiful ways. If you could use a little relaxation right now, roll out your yoga mat and flow through Hie Kim’s <a href="https://youtu.be/mVTfsvR8eGc">Super Slow Flow</a>. </p>



<p>Happy Savasana!</p>

<p class="intro-text">While some yogis and yoginis might describe Yin Yoga as too easy, boring, or passive, others appreciate the emotional and muscular releases that the <strong>long duration of Yin Yoga poses</strong> entails.</p>



<p>Yin Yoga, as it suggests, is the opposite and also complement of dynamic and muscular challenging (Yang) <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/categories/yoga-styles/">yoga styles</a> like Vinyasa Flow or <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/budokon-a-combined-practice-of-yoga-martial-arts-and-calisthenics/">Budokon</a>. Therefore, flowing through Yin Yoga poses is very slow and calm. It can <strong>deepen the awareness of the body</strong> and its limits through a meditative stillness in a pose. Yin Yoga can be seen as a balance to any dynamic yoga style, they benefit from each other. It does not require any specific yoga level but is suitable for every yoga student.</p>

<h2 id="1">1. What is Yin Yoga?</h2>



<p>Yin Yoga describes a calm, meditative and reflective yoga practice. It is a practice of stillness and deep work, and the asanas are based upon <strong>sitting and recumbent positions</strong>. Because Yin Yoga is all about the long and <strong>deep stretch</strong>, standing asanas are mostly disregarded as they involve the muscles to engage. Practitioners hold Yin Yoga poses for at least <a href="https://yinyoga.com/yinsights/what-is-yin-yoga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one but up to twenty minutes</a>. Sounds exhausting? Well, let’s say you will not be out of breath, but on a physical and mental level Yin Yoga poses can indeed push you to your limits.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>1.1 Relax With Yin Yoga Poses to Release Tension in the Deep Tissues</h3>



<p>Let’s look at the main characteristics of Yin Yoga. The term “Yin” in this context refers especially to the passiveness of the practice as well as the tissues it targets. The opposite “Yang” describes the active asanas that involve strength and engaged muscles. Instead of flowing through a challenging sequence of postures like in Vinyasa Yoga, in Yin Yoga you move into a pose – and then, you stay there. There is no need to move, instead you wait for your body to relax into its deeper layers of tissue. You <strong>should not wiggle yourself deeper</strong>, fidget, or otherwise move, because that would activate the muscles which would hinder you from stretching and releasing. </p>



<p>In Yin Yoga, you relax the muscles (and the mind) to <strong>work the deep connective tissues</strong> which are mainly fascia but also bones, joints, and ligaments. Conscious breathwork helps further to set the intention on <strong>release and opening</strong>, e.g. of hips or hamstrings. You commit and remain still, accepting and letting go of any urge to move that might come up. Think: “Release.”</p>

<p class="caption">Release tension with the Yin mindfulness Yoga trainer <a href="https://tintyoga.com/instructors/chris-su/">Chris Su</a>.</p>
</div>



<p>Especially during rough and stressful times, Yin Yoga helps yogis and yoginis to <strong>slow down and find inner peace</strong>. In his <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/programs/the-power-of-deep-and-mindful-relaxation">7-session series “The Power of Deep and Mindful Relaxation”</a>, the Yin Yoga Trainer Chris Su will support you on your way to deep relaxation, regeneration, and relieving stress to feel more energy on your journey to personal fulfillment and success. The sessions vary in focus – from Yin for the digestive system to Yin for grounding. Physically, the sessions benefit your <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/can-yoga-really-increase-mobility-and-flexibility/">physical flexibility and mobility</a>. Mentally, you will <strong>cultivate strength and resilience</strong> and create deeper levels of concentration and calmness.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>1.2 Breathing Through Intense Stretching Sensation&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Yin Yoga is often considered as painful. Therefore, always keep in mind: In every asana, only go as far as you feel a significant resistance. There is a difference between the desired sore feeling of tissue stretching through long-held asanas and the pain that can damage your body – or between <strong>“good” and “bad” pain</strong>. </p>



<p>The very common and good <a href="https://yinyoga.com/good-pain-bad-pain-some-pain-no-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resistance sensation</a> can feel mild, stretchy, tugging, and deep. However, holding a Yin Yoga pose can also feel like a sharp, burning, or pinching pain. In that case, move out of the pose or change it until you do not feel the pain anymore. To help you estimate if this is good or bad pain, ask yourself the question:&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">“What keeps me from stretching deeper?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the answer is “Dramatic pain”, then stop immediately and consult a Yin Yoga teacher about the issue. Remember to <strong>always listen to your body</strong> and <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/positivity/">be kind to yourself</a>. If the answer, on the other hand, is “Because I just can’t” or “I don’t want to”, then this is your ego that tries to keep you in your comfort zone, in your territory of well-known experience and habits. </p>



<p>In the case of the latter, it will help to <strong>endure the discomfort</strong> and even enjoy the sensation if you <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/pranayama-an-intro-to-the-power-of-yogic-breathing/">reconnect to your breath</a>. Regulate it to relax yourself and to loosen tightness in your body. Breathe calmly and deepen the awareness of your body. Learn how to breathe mindfully with Chris Su to be able to apply what you learnt during a Yin yoga sequence.&nbsp;</p>

</div>



<p>The ego might also motivate you to go deeper into the stretch than is actually good for you. Be aware of thoughts like “I can go deeper – look, other people are doing it, too” or “I need to go deeper than the last time”. Silence them and <strong>accept your limit</strong>. It is a fine line – find your own unique way into the Yin Yoga pose.</p>



<p>Special attention is required when coming-out of a Yin Yoga pose. Be careful and gentle because once you have sunk into a pose, it can be difficult to move out of it again. Most likely you will <strong>feel relief but also fragility</strong>. For one, five or even twenty minutes you have been pulling your body apart – and holding it apart. So be gentle and let your body slowly adjust back into its natural state of being.&nbsp;</p>





<h2 id="2">2. Why can Yin Yoga poses be emotionally intense?</h2>



<p>Generally, yoga practices can be very emotional. It is common that when <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/why-music-is-important/">flowing to a certain type of music or song</a>, yoginis and yogis shed a few tears. Often, the melody of the music or the message of the song lets them connect to a memory or an emotion in their heart that has not been felt to heal yet. However, yoga is still a physical and energetic work of the body. Yin Yoga poses may <strong>stimulate certain meridians of the body</strong> and <a href="https://yinyoga.com/issues-in-our-tissues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cause an emotional reaction</a>. </p>



<p>Have you heard of the saying “<strong>issues in our tissues</strong>” before?&nbsp;</p>



<p>When emotions are repressed, our body may store them in our deep connective tissues. Imagine, for example, that you are scared, where can you feel it in your body? Your breathing becomes very flat or short (you might even hold it), your chest becomes tight, your heart beats faster, the tension in your body increases – because technically your body prepares to fight, flight, or freeze. If the energy cannot be released after the event, the bodily sensations and emotions can then be repressed and may be stored in your body&#8217;s tissue. </p>

</div>



<p>The inner thighs could become tense resulting from the missed opportunity to rather run, the tissue of the lungs can become stiffer because they did not have the opportunity to breathe fast and loud. Yin Yoga poses can help to gently <strong>dissolve those body traumas </strong>and in the process heavy emotions can arise. You can try this by letting Mirjam Wagner guide you through the process of <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/programs/letting-go">letting go</a> emotions through Yin Yoga poses for the hips and lower spine.</p>



<p>So when feelings arise or memories come up in certain Yin yoga poses, observe them, accept them, do not try to change or escape them. Pay attention to <strong>what you are feeling</strong>, which area of the body is sore, and how your breath behaves. Sometimes it can be helpful to also note <a href="https://tintyoga.com/de/magazine/chakra-yoga/">which chakra lies in the area of the body</a> and, hence, which topic can be associated with the sensation. </p>



<p>If the pain is too much to bear, whether physical or emotional, then accept that as well. You might not be ready yet, so gently just return to it some other time. If you <strong>experience blockages</strong> in certain areas of your body, you can try Chakra yoga with Faith Hunter in addition to Yin Yoga to remove blockages from your energy flow.</p>

<h2 id="3">3. What benefits does Yin Yoga hold for your physical body?</h2>



<p>Yin Yoga has several health benefits, both physically and mentally. In Yin Yoga especially, you might notice more than during the practice of other yoga styles how much your physical body and your emotional and energetic body are connected.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>3.1 More Flexibility, Less Stiffness&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Physically Yin Yoga is about releasing tension of the body. You benefit from gaining more flexibility as your deep connective tissue like fascia becomes smoother. Any pain in neck, shoulders, hips, or back may be dissolved by holding a neck releasing asana for a few minutes and breathing through the stretching discomfort.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>3.2 Improved Digestive System Functions</strong></h3>



<p>You might not believe it, but some asanas are particularly helpful for your digestive system. If you feel queasy, bloated, or clogged, then Chris Su offers <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/programs/the-power-of-deep-and-mindful-relaxation?cid=248003&amp;permalink=p052_chris-su_session-02_1080p">Yin Yoga poses</a> that foster the <strong>regulation of your stomach</strong> and intestines. As the practice is very calming, accumulated stress that you might feel in your gut through your adrenaline glands can decrease and further improve indigestion.&nbsp;</p>





<h3><strong>3.3 Inner Balance and Resilience&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Another benefit of Yin Yoga is that it improves body awareness. Taking time to listen and feel the body and its sensations can help to discover blind spots within the body that you had been unaware of before. Holding a Yin Yoga pose for longer is a great opportunity to <strong>observe the mind</strong> and sharpen the self-perception. </p>



<p>As some deep connective tissues may store emotions like anger, fear, and sadness, Yin Yoga can work to dissolve them and help to build up resilience for a stronger foundation by facing intense emotions. Thereby, the practice can help to re-establish inner peace and balance. </p>



<p>If inner peace and balance prevail, it will be easier to face and handle challenging situations in the future. The regular practice will help <strong>recognize signals of stress</strong> from the body earlier as well as help to regenerate from negative emotions that reign the mind and therefore also the body. If you are curious to find out what Yin Yoga can do to you, sink onto your mat and flow through a Yin yoga sequence to relax and regenerate with Chris Su.&nbsp;</p>

</div>



<h2 id="4">4. Which poses can be included into your Yin Yoga sequence?</h2>



<p>Many Yin Yoga poses revolve around opening the hips, the thighs, and lengthening the spine. Nonetheless, some asanas also help to release tension in the feet, the chest, or the shoulders. In most Yin Yoga sequences, props are a prerequisite. <strong>Blankets, yoga blocks, pillows, bolsters</strong>, and other cushions help students to relax into an asana. In Reclining Hero Pose (Supta Virasana), for example, sitting on a higher pillow can decrease the stress on the knees. If bending down on the ground is too difficult, you could use cushions to lie back on, and rest your head even higher on another pillow. As an example, see below how in Cow Face pose (Gomukhasana) the head can be rested on a yoga block to easier relax into the pose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>4.1 13 Asanas to Sequence a Yin Yoga Class</strong></h3>



<p>To give you a head start and some ideas for your Yin Yoga sequence, we put together a list of thirteen common asanas. Always be aware of each of your students and their level of deep work. Be on your toes to <strong>assist them</strong> if they need more props in a position. Some students also appreciate your <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/hands-on-yoga-adjustments/">gentle adjustment </a>and touch in certain positions to feel safer. It might be easier for them to let go of the tension that keeps them from lowering into a Yin Yoga pose if you gently stretch their shoulders, for example.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Toe squat (Vajrasana variation on toes)&nbsp;</li><li>Lizard pose (Utthan Pristhasana)</li><li>One-Legged King Pigeon pose (Eka Pada Rajakapotasana)</li><li>Cow Face pose (Gomukhasana)</li><li>Butterfly pose (Baddha Konasana)</li><li>Squat pose (Malasana)&nbsp;</li><li>Frog pose (Mandukasana)</li><li>Sphinx pose (Salamba Bhujangasana)&nbsp;</li><li>Melting Heart / Puppy Dog pose (Anahatasana)</li><li>Cat Tail pose</li><li>Child’s pose (Balasana)</li><li>Thread the needle pose (Parsva Balasana)</li><li>Supine Pigeon Pose (Supta Kapotasana)</li></ul>

<h3><strong>4.2 Tips to Design Your Yin Yoga Sequence</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://yinyoga.com/yinsights/asanas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Grilley</a>, one of the yogis considered as the founders of Yin Yoga, once said: </p>



<div class="quote-wrapper">
<p class="quote">&#8220;The more yin your practice, the less variety is needed and the emphasis is placed on a few basic postures.&#8221;</p>
<p class="quote-author">– Paul Grilley.</p>
</div>



<p>Keep this in mind when you design your class. Below, you can find two possible examples how you might build your Yin Yoga sequence:</p>



<ul><li>If you design a 60-minute Yin Yoga class, you may guide your students to <strong>hold an asana for 3 minutes</strong>. After a 5-minute introduction and centering, you pick max. 12 asanas to set up the class. In the end, ease them into a 5-minute Shavasana.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>If you design a 90-minute Yin Yoga class, you may choose to <strong>hold a pose for 7 minutes</strong>. Take 5 minutes to center your students in the beginning. Then pick max. 10 asanas for the class. Give them 10 minutes in Shavasana to release any tension that might still be left.&nbsp;</li></ul>





<p>You may also <strong>vary the length</strong> of holding certain positions. Some asanas like Child&#8217;s pose are most likely less exhausting than Dragon pose. Therefore, you might have your students stay in Child’s pose for 5 minutes, while you help them out of Dragon pose after 3 minutes. Remember these three aspects for your Yin Yoga sequence:</p>



<ul><li>When you decide to guide your students into Pigeon pose, do not forget to do both sides. This will account for two asanas when you put together your Yin Yoga sequence.&nbsp;</li><li>Your students may need time to release a pose before they move into the next asana. Rather than stressing from one Yin Yoga pose to the next, keep it calm and do not do all the asanas you prepared. </li><li>Of course, you do not have to stick to the minutes as you planned. Read your students. If you see them struggling too much or if they often come out of a pose earlier, then talk to them, receive feedback, and adjust your teaching accordingly. </li></ul>



<h3><strong>4.3 Yinvasana to End the Yoga Class</strong></h3>



<p>Another great opportunity is to incorporate Yin Yoga poses into your Shavasana. This is also called Yinvasana. Instead of lying flat on your back, you move your body into an asana like Janu Sirsasana (Head to knee pose) and remain there while letting your body relax into the pose after your yoga practice like Hie Kim demonstrates in the <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/programs/calm-down-with-shavasana?categoryId=45413">Shavasana Series</a>. Another great way to lead the students’ into a deeper relaxation during Shavasana or Yinvasana is by <strong>gently guiding their thoughts</strong>. Reciting or <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/programs/calm-down-with-shavasana?cid=2504615&amp;permalink=p267_09_connection-poem_calm-down-with-shavasana-e2a833">reading poetry</a> like Hie Kim can inspire them to feel lyrical joy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="intro-text">Wouldn’t it be great to have <strong>a yoga room at home</strong>, or at least a little corner somewhere in your home – a calm, sacred space just for you?</p>



<p>Nothing compares to a warm, calm, and cozy yoga studio that creates a soothing atmosphere and makes you <strong>feel at peace</strong> as soon as you enter it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the reality is that not everyone can go to their favorite yoga studio as often as they would like to. Sometimes, life gets in the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The good news – and one of the greatest things about yoga – is that <strong>it doesn’t take much to create room for your yoga practice in your home</strong>. Yoga can practically be done anywhere without a bunch of bulky equipment.</p>



<p>We have gathered a few tips for you on how to <strong>create, design, and decorate your yoga room</strong> or corner in your home so that you can dive into your yoga practice – with a completely present and grounded mind.</p>

<h1 id="1">1. 5 Reasons for a Yoga Room at Home</h1>



<p>But let’s start with another question: Why in the world would you need a dedicated space for your yoga practice in your home?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, as already mentioned, sometimes <strong>your schedule or other responsibilities</strong> like work, family, friends, etc. won’t allow you to commute to a yoga studio as often as you’d like. But maybe, you don’t feel safe practicing yoga around other people because you’re introverted, injured, or feel insecure for other reasons. </p>



<p>Maybe, other restrictions prevent you from gathering with many people. In such cases, it’s great to <strong>have your own space for your yoga session at home</strong> where you can practice for yourself or use online platforms such as <a href="https://tintyoga.com/">TINT</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But why don’t you just practice anywhere? Well, asana practice is best done in a <strong>separate and soothing place </strong>that brings you into a peaceful state of mind – far away from the stress of the outside world. For most people, this is not possible between your kids’ toys, work documents, and dirty dishes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from that, a dedicated spot for your at-home yoga practice <strong>acts as a little reminder</strong> to get on the mat regularly. It can also motivate you and get you in the right mood to step on your yoga mat and move. Simply put, a yoga room at home helps your brain to switch into the “yoga mode”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s look at <strong>5 reasons</strong> to create a yoga room at home.</p>



<h2>Reason #1: Focus&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Once you’ve created a separate spot for your yoga practice – be it an entire separate room, a small nook or corner – it will become <strong>your own sacred territory</strong>. This way, you can actually train your mind to switch off and let go of any thoughts and worries about your social life, the household, work, or other things that bother you. As soon as you step into your yoga area, you’ll be able to focus on yourself and your yoga practice.</p>



<p>The good thing about a separate yoga space is that you can <strong>prevent others from coming in and disturbing your practice</strong>. The same goes for any other distraction such as electronic devices: Your smartphone or laptop has nothing to do in your yoga space unless you use it to stream <a href="https://tintyoga.com/pricing/">online yoga videos</a> or play music. In that case, make sure you turn off any other notifications while practicing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="caption">A yoga room at home is great if you love to practice yoga online with providers like <a href="https://tintyoga.com">TINT</a>.</p>



<h2>Reason #2: Motivation</h2>



<p>You probably know these days when you simply don&#8217;t feel like doing anything. Even though you know how good you feel after a yoga session, you sometimes just don&#8217;t want to practice at all. However, if you have a nicely decorated yoga room at your home where you feel comfortable, <strong>it will be much easier for you</strong> to step on your yoga mat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also<strong> trick yourself </strong>by simply enjoying the coziness and beauty of your yoga spot and casually sitting on your yoga mat. Maybe you want to switch on your favorite yoga music, light some candles and incense sticks and – all of a sudden – your body starts to move and stretch and you’re in the middle of your yoga practice.</p>



<h2>Reason #3: Relaxation</h2>



<p>The same trick may help you to calm down and find relaxation after a stressful day or before a full day ahead. Wouldn’t it be great to <strong>have a tiny little physical space just for you</strong> to give your mind some rest and get some emotional space, too? </p>



<p>Just give it a go: Whenever you feel sad, vulnerable, anxious, or stressed, <strong>back off into your yoga room at home</strong>, indulge in your favorite music, candlelight, and the smell of incense sticks. Allow yourself to enjoy the stillness and relaxation with this little self-care treatment.</p>



<h2>Reason #4: Mindfulness</h2>



<p>Here’s the best thing: You don’t have to use your yoga space exclusively for your asana practice. Instead, <strong>consider it a room for yourself </strong>where you can spend some time without any distractions: Use your yoga room for journaling, reflecting, meditating, reading, and any other mindfulness practices and routines.</p>



<h2>Reason #5: Creativity&nbsp;</h2>



<p>While you don’t have to be an interior designer, decorating and setting up your own yoga room at home can be so much fun! This is a great chance to <strong>discover your creative side</strong>. Even more so with all the beautiful accessories and tools for yoga that you can easily buy on the internet nowadays. </p>



<p>And if you want to be really serious about that, you can even <strong>handcraft parts of your decorations yourself</strong> such as dream catchers, tapestry, or macrame. This way, you can add an even more personal touch to your yoga corner.</p>



<p>In the end, <strong>it all comes down to your own intention</strong>:&nbsp; Do you want to create a space for your yoga (asana) practice, create a little reminder to practice yoga, or set up a sacred space just for your own well-being? </p>

<h1 id="2">2. 9 Tips How to Set Up a Yoga Room at Home</h1>



<p>As already mentioned, your yoga space doesn’t necessarily have to be an entire room at home, it can be a small corner in your bedroom, living room, or any other room that <strong>allows enough space</strong>. Don’t limit yourself because you want too much: sometimes a tiny niche with a candle and a small rug is enough to give you the space to focus on yourself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also depends on the yoga style you want to practice: While you will need more space for <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/categories/inside-flow">Inside Flow</a> or <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/categories/vinyasa">Vinyasa</a> yoga, you don’t need much for calmer practices such as Yin yoga or meditation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most important thing to remember is to <strong>keep it simple</strong>. Setting up a yoga room or corner at home can be as easy as that:&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Make some space.</p>



<p>2. Roll out your yoga mat.</p>



<p>3. Make sure you remain undisturbed.</p>



<p>4. Practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if you mean serious business, you can get as crazy as you want here. We have collected <strong>9 tips</strong> that help you to set up your own yoga room at home or create your own little yoga corner.&nbsp;</p>





<h2>Tip #1: Declutter the Space</h2>



<p>A cluttered space leads to a cluttered mind. So, if you want to <strong>focus your attention</strong> on your yoga practice, it’s essential to remove anything you don’t need for that purpose. Only invite things into your yoga space at home that are either functional or inspirational. Take out everything else. Otherwise, your mind will feel overwhelmed and restless.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>This means that you should </strong>get rid of any unnecessary stuff in the room like clothes, books, electronic devices, etc. Remove any tables or chairs (or, at least, move them aside).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, <strong>avoid overdoing it </strong>with decorations and accessories. Keep it simple but tasteful. Many yoginis and yogis find it actually most inspiring to have nothing but the yoga mat in their yoga space. This way, it’s easier to stay focused and not get distracted.</p>



<h2>Tip #2: Bring in Nature &amp; Plants</h2>



<p>Our chaotic and busy lives rarely give us the chance to go out regularly and enjoy the calming effects of nature. <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/tips-for-everyday-living/nature-and-mental-health/how-nature-benefits-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Researchers</a> found that spending time in <strong>nature helps with mental health problems</strong> such as anxiety and depression. There’s also strong <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6379348/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidence</a> that the green color has a calming and relaxing effect on the human organism.</p>



<p>However, not everyone is lucky enough to be surrounded by beautiful green nature. But you can bring nature into your yoga room at home with <strong>indoor plants</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419447/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Studies</a> have shown that <strong>indoor plants may reduce stress</strong> by suppressing autonomic nervous system activity. So, making your yoga room a greener space is one of the best things you can do for yourself.</p>



<p>And by the way: If you don’t have a green thumb, you can at least use <strong>artificial plants or a bouquet of flowers</strong> that you exchange frequently.</p>

</div>



<h2>Tip #3: Choose the Right Lighting</h2>



<p>The next element to consider is the lighting in your yoga space at home. If you can, <strong>opt for natural light</strong> rather than artificial light. However, if there’s no natural sunlight in your yoga room, choose lighting that comes as close as possible to natural light. </p>



<p>Soft white light mimics daylight bulbs while bright artificial lights can cause eyestrain and headache – certainly nothing you want to deal with during your yoga practice!</p>



<p>If possible, <strong>adjust the direction of overhead lamps</strong> in such a way that they shine down on you instead of directly into your eyes. This avoids confusing and annoying shadows. If electric light doesn’t work at all for you, you can also consider the possibility of using candles only.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Tip #4: Pick Suitable Colors</h2>



<p>Color is another critical element in making your yoga room at home as inviting and comforting as possible. This really is a matter of taste: Use any colors that <strong>help you relax during your yoga sessions</strong>. However, you may find that earthy tones such as green and brown or light cool tones such as blue and lavender will have the best soothing effect on your nervous system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may also want to <strong>avoid bright colors</strong> such as red or yellow as they tend to be stimulating rather than soothing. However, if that is more what you need for your yoga practice at home, go for it!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, <strong>keep the contrasts low</strong> and avoid mixing up light and dark colors. This does not only look odd but can also create headaches. In general, soft and calm colors may be the best choice for a relaxing space to practice yoga or meditate.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Tip #5: Decorate the Walls&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The easiest and cheapest way to decorate your walls is by <strong>using posters and tapestries</strong>. They also look very stylish and are super versatile. They can vary from photos of natural items or landscapes to patterns or mandalas and will bring a completely different energy to the walls of your yoga room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want to <strong>create a more spiritual environment</strong>, you can choose posters or tapestries with pictures of Hindu gods or other yogic, ayurvedic, and zen posters that serve as inspirational guides for your yoga practice. You could even hang up a picture of your guru or a poster of a specific yoga sequence that you enjoy practicing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don’t have a full room dedicated to yoga, tapestries and posters are also a great way to <strong>separate your yoga corner from the rest of the room</strong>.</p>





<h2>Tip #6: Install Mirrors for Alignment&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Especially for your home yoga practice, where you can’t benefit from the <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/hands-on-yoga-adjustments/">hands-on adjustments</a> of an experienced yoga teacher, <strong>it’s crucial to stay properly aligned</strong> in order to avoid injuries. Mirrors are a great tool for that and complete the yoga studio vibe at your home yoga space. What’s more, they make even a small corner feel more open and spacious.</p>



<p>Especially <a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/teaching-yoga-to-beginners">yoga beginners</a> may find it helpful to <strong>practice in front of a mirror</strong> until they learn how their bodies should align in certain poses. Consider it a valuable tool that helps you train your body intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you find big mirrors distracting, you can opt for <strong>smaller decorative mirrors</strong>. They will not only help you with posture guidance but will also turn a simple white wall into a fancy piece of your yoga space.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Tip #7: Use Candles, Scents &amp; Essential Oils</h2>



<p>Scents are a <strong>powerful grounding force</strong>. Maybe you already noticed how the smell of certain foods awakens childhood memories or how certain smells remind you of particular people or situations. Assuming that these are good memories, you will instantly get into a more peaceful and balanced state of mind.</p>



<p>You can use this same psychology to <strong>train your brain to reach a state of peacefulness </strong>when you step onto your yoga mat in your yoga room at home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One possibility to please your olfactory senses is <strong>using essential oils and natural candles</strong>. If you want to add a more spiritual element to your yoga practice, you can even use different scents to target specific <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/chakra-yoga/">Chakras</a> or promote specific feelings.</p>



<p>If that sounds comforting to you, you can also <strong>burn a bundle of healing herbs</strong> to clear the energy in the room before your yoga practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The great thing about using candles, scents, and essential oils in your yoga room or corner is that <strong>your entire home will smell amazing.</strong></p>



<p>Apart from that, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5198031/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a> suggests that “fragrances may directly and/or indirectly affect the psychological and physiological conditions of humans. [&#8230; They] can also significantly modulate the activities of different brain waves and are responsible for various states of the brain”.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tip #8: Include Spiritual Elements</h2>



<p>If you’re a rather spiritual yogi, you may want to take the decor of your yoga room one step further by <strong>creating a small altar </strong>of crystals, miniature statues, a beautiful piece collected from nature and other spiritual elements. If that helps you to ignite your soul, connect to your inner wisdom, and bring fresh energy into your yoga practice, go for it!</p>



<p>Crystals and gemstones, for example, are commonly used by yogis to enhance your energies, support your intention, and increase your inner strength. Anyway, even if you don’t believe in the healing powers of crystals, they are <strong>beautiful decorative elements</strong> that create a truly yogic feeling in your yoga space at home.</p>



<p>And even if you’re not so much on the spiritual side, <strong>small yogic figurines</strong> can also add a nice touch to your yoga space, make you smile, and remind you to practice and meditate.</p>



<p>Another piece of decoration that fits nicely into your yoga space is a <strong>singing bowl</strong> – either for pure decorative purposes or to use its sound to get you into the right mood for the yoga practice. Which brings us to the next tip.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tip #9: Think About Sound</h2>



<p>The last – often neglected – element we want to look at is sound. That is, if you prefer to practice in complete silence, you don’t need to worry about that. </p>



<p>However, if music helps you to get into a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224927532_Flow_The_Psychology_of_Optimal_Experience" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flow state of mind</a>, you should definitely think about the sound system you want to use. This becomes even more important if you practice a yoga style that includes music as a crucial part of the practice, such as <a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/inside-flow-yoga-teaches-us-a-lot-about-grace">Inside Flow</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, since you’ll probably be using your yoga room at home during the day, ambient noise such as traffic or other sounds from outside your window can sometimes be disruptive. In that case, you can use music or nature sounds to <strong>drown out these outside noises</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="3">3. Tools You Need in Your Yoga Room at Home</h1>



<p>After you’ve set up your yoga room or yoga corner at home and thought about all the decorative and organizational things, it’s time to look at the most important question when it comes to designing your yoga space: <strong>What to put in there?</strong></p>



<p>Well, first of all, <strong>think minimalistic</strong>. A yoga room doesn’t have to be complicated. It can actually be as simple as rolling out your yoga mat. And that’s it.</p>



<p>If you want to <strong>have more equipment</strong>, you can add yoga blocks, straps, blankets, and bolsters that you can use to support you in certain poses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don’t want to invest in these tools right away, you can <strong>use things you already have at home</strong>: Use blankets instead of mats, books instead of blocks as props for poses, and pillows or cushions instead of bolsters. Scarves or belts are in no way inferior to “proper” yoga belts and will work just fine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simplicity is key here. <strong>The less the better</strong>. Especially if you’re just starting with your home yoga practice, avoid adding too much to the room as this may feel overwhelming. Keep it simple and wait until you get a better feeling for what you really need for your yoga practice.</p>



<p>Finally, keep in mind that yoga is not about having the latest and fanciest accessories and tools. And it’s not about showing them off, either. <strong>Yoga rather is about quieting your mind</strong> and moving toward more awareness and inner peace.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="intro-text">One of the most delicate aspects of teaching yoga is physically assisting your students by giving them <strong>hands-on yoga adjustments</strong>. Guiding your students verbally is one thing, but to actually put your hands on their bodies is a totally different thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Physical touch is a direct and very intimate form of <strong>communicating with your students</strong>. Intelligent and thoughtful hands-on assists can transform a student’s yoga practice. But inappropriate and improper adjustments can lead to confusion or even injury of your students.</p>



<p>What is more, yoga adjustment is an area that bears <strong>a high risk of misunderstandings.</strong> This is especially true because you usually don’t receive direct and honest feedback from your students. Therefore, every yoga teacher needs to know how to communicate in a professional and unambiguous way when touching students in order to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.</p>



<p>Note that, while it is also possible to assist your students with verbal yoga adjustments or teach them how to apply self-adjustments in their own yoga practice, we want to<strong> focus on hands-on yoga assists</strong> here.</p>

<h1 id="1">1. Why Yoga Teachers Touch Their Students</h1>



<h2>1.1. The Importance of Touch in Yoga</h2>



<p>In most situations of our lives, it’s inappropriate to place your hands on people – especially if you don’t know them very well (because they share a bed with you, for example). Well, a <strong>yoga studio</strong> is the one place where this kind of intimate practice is acceptable.</p>



<p>A skillful yoga teacher can communicate with their students by <strong>transferring information through the touch of their hands</strong>. In this case, it’s especially important to make sure that a student knows that being touched is an integral part of the yoga practice and that certain corrections are necessary to avoid injuries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main reason for touching students in a yoga class is to <strong>help their alignment</strong>. However, you will inevitably also connect to your students and come closer emotionally. This entails a lot of responsibility because touching people with your hands is a very intimate action.</p>



<p>While some students may not mind hands-on assists, others don’t want to be touched at all as this may feel intrusive. Therefore, a yoga teacher always needs to be careful when and how to touch people and <strong>consider the right time and place</strong> to perform hands-on adjustments. </p>



<p>When you, as a yoga teacher, know how to apply touch, this is a great tool to <strong>bond with your students</strong>, especially in a society that becomes more and more distant. Thousands of friends on social media cannot replace the unique and bonding experience of physical contact that creates a feeling of community and belonging. Humans are social beings and not made for being alone. Just think of kids who crave hugs and cuddles.</p>



<p>However, as a yoga teacher, you need to remember that <strong>you don’t want to create a community based on misunderstandings</strong>, for example, because your touch is too intimate. After all, yoga is a physical practice that also reaches your students’ minds and emotions. This is a combination that makes it very easy for students to misunderstand your intentions. You may unintentionally create an environment where it’s easy to fall in love. This makes physical touch an even more delicate thing as it can create real misunderstandings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditionally in yoga, the relationship between master and disciple was quite different from what it is nowadays. It used to be a much closer relationship but was often <strong>characterized by an imbalance of power</strong>. The tactile stimuli used by the teacher were rougher and it was not unusual to enter the disciple’s privacy in a quite intimate way. Hence, traditional yoga adjustments often are more forceful and sometimes even touch areas which we will exclude below.</p>



<p>However, in our modern society, we don’t have this kind of relationship with our students. Plus, social norms and habits have changed, as described above, and an imbalance of power between yoga teacher and student <strong>is simply not acceptable</strong>.</p>



<p>Therefore, a yoga teacher must <strong>know exactly how to touch students</strong>. While you want to create an environment where people open up, you don’t want to create misunderstandings.</p>



<p>Although your intention may be pure, the most important thing is what your students understand and feel. As a yoga teacher, <strong>you carry the huge responsibility</strong> of bonding with your students without crossing the line.</p>

<h2>1.2. Reasons to Adjust Students in a Yoga Class</h2>



<p>Every yoga student prefers a <strong>different way of learning</strong>. A great yoga teacher can identify these different learning methods and structure their teaching practices accordingly. While some students can apply the correct yoga alignment by listening to verbal instructions only, others need to actually feel the alignment by being adjusted physically.</p>



<p>The fact is, if you want to survive as a yoga teacher, <strong>you need to master adjustments</strong>. This is what really creates an added value to an in-person class in comparison to an online class. Of course, you can provide great alignment, instructions, and cues online, but you cannot provide hands-on assists to your students. This is why you need to master the skill of yoga adjustment to survive in the yoga market.</p>



<p>Here are some of the main reasons why hands-on assists in yoga are so important.</p>



<h3>1.2.1. Posture Guiding &amp; Alignment Correction</h3>



<p>Sometimes, a student really struggles to safely get into a certain yoga pose and, thus, risks getting injured. In other instances, a student may have the right idea of the yoga pose but struggles with the correct alignment. This also bears the risk of serious injury and, thus requires the yoga teacher to intervene and <strong>support the student with a hands-on adjustment</strong>.</p>



<p>One common misalignment, for example, is the front knee falling in in <a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/warrior-1-yoga-position">Warrior I</a> and <a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/warrior-2-yoga-pose">Warrior II</a>. This is not a problem if it happens once, but can damage the knee in the long term if not corrected by a yoga teacher. In such cases, hands-on adjustments can be used to s<strong>afely guide a student into the correct posture</strong>.</p>





<h3>1.2.2. Going Deeper &amp; Muscle-Memory Instructions</h3>



<p>When a student has managed to correctly get into the pose with the right alignment, they may not (yet) be able to move into the pose deeply enough to experience all its benefits. A skillful yoga teacher should be able to help their students when it comes to these poses by<strong> providing physical assistance</strong>. </p>



<p>Apart from that, experienced yoga teachers may even be able to tell whether their student is feeling which benefits they are supposed to feel in a certain pose. If not, hands-on adjustments can be used to <strong>show students what the benefits of a certain pose should feel like</strong>. </p>



<p>This means that hands-on assists can <strong>train the students’ body intelligence </strong>and help them to fully perform the pose next time they practice it. This way, intelligent physical adjustments allow students to get the most out of their future classes. </p>



<p>And this is the point where you as a yoga teacher can really make a difference and create a long-term effect and sustainable change in your students.</p>



<h3>1.2.3. Breathing Assistance</h3>



<p>It may sound a bit weird that a person could require help with their breathing. However, it’s a fact that the correct breathing technique can tremendously increase the benefits of a yoga practice. In these scenarios, you can help your students to identify the right breathing points by providing hands-on adjustments. This is a great way to enable your students to get the most out of your yoga class.</p>

</div>



<h3>1.2.4. Summary: When to Adjust</h3>



<p>In general, you need to remember that <strong>adjustment always is an extension of alignment</strong>. As we’ve already seen above, touching people is a delicate topic. Therefore, you always need to make sure that any hands-on assist you give a student makes perfect sense.</p>



<p>Ask yourself the following questions <strong>before</strong> touching any of your students in a yoga pose:</p>



<ul><li>Is this yoga adjustment <strong>beneficial</strong> for the student, or am I just exerting power?</li><li>Does this student <strong>really</strong> need a hands-on yoga assist or do I just want to show off?</li><li>Am I <strong>calm and steady</strong> while I adjust this student, or am I restless and in a rush?</li><li>Am I <strong>100 percent</strong> focused on this student, or am I thinking of something else?</li><li>Am I <strong>properly trained</strong> to carry out this hands-on assist in a safe, healthy and efficient manner?</li><li>Do I <strong>know</strong> what I’m doing, i.e. am I sure not to hurt my student?</li></ul>



<p>If you fail to answer one of these questions with certainty, <strong>don’t provide a hands-on adjustment</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="2">2.&nbsp;Inappropriate Yoga Adjustments</h2>



<p>Apart from your own uncertainty or lack of experience when it comes to hands-on assists, there are other instances or reasons why it may <strong>not be appropriate to touch your students</strong>.</p>



<p>In particular, there are <strong>certain areas of the body</strong> that you should NOT touch when providing adjustments in yoga. These include:</p>



<ul><li>the sexual organs;</li><li>the breasts and the chest area;</li><li>the insides of the thighs;</li><li>the buttocks and tailbone;</li><li>the armpits;</li><li>the belly area;</li><li>the head including crown of the head, face and chin; and</li><li>individual personal sensitive spots (e.g. feet).</li></ul>



<p>Apart from knowing where to touch your students, you also need to know <strong>how to touch</strong>. Although a good intention is a good start, it is not enough. The correct technique is equally important.</p>



<p>If, for example, the student you’re approaching to provide a hands-on adjustment <strong>shows any level of unwillingness or rejection</strong>, it’s important to respect their wishes. This is because you can never know the students’ entire story. You don’t know what they may have experienced in the past and why they’re so reluctant to physical touch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any adjustment should be carried out in a way that <strong>counteracts compression</strong>. This takes the pressure off the joints and allows students to deepen their breath.</p>



<p>Also, your students should <strong>feel an immediate change</strong> in their alignment as a result of your adjustment. Otherwise, why adjust at all?</p>



<p>This means that you need to make sure you have a<strong> thorough understanding of both the pose’s alignment and adjustment </strong>before giving any hands-on assists. This involves having received the adjustment yourself and having practiced it on other persons like teachers, friends, and your students (ranging from your “best” students to newer students and even injured students). </p>



<p>Once you have worked through the challenges of a yoga pose, you’ll be better equipped to help someone else with exactly these challenges. Always <strong>practice with real people </strong>as this gives you the best feedback regarding how to touch, how to move, and how your student reacts.</p>



<p>Needless to say that you also must have a<strong> sound understanding of your students’ limitations and/or injuries </strong>before touching them in any pose.</p>



<p>Finally, <strong>avoid touching too much and too many different areas</strong> because this is too much information for the brain to process. This is especially true for <a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/teaching-yoga-to-beginners">yoga beginners</a>. Do not overly adjust them as they may get discouraged if they think that they’re doing all the poses incorrectly. In addition, you’re still forming a relationship and establishing trust with new students. </p>



<p>On the other hand, it’s particularly important to adjust beginners if you see that they’re <strong>at risk of harming themselves</strong> or if you feel you can help them find more ease in a pose. Beginners tend to think that yoga has to hurt and, thus, will not notice right away when they’re not correctly aligned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While there are general guidelines that should be considered when it comes to hands-on assists, it’s important to remember that <strong>each and every student is different</strong>. This means that the application of these guidelines can differ significantly from student to student. Accordingly, yoga adjustments must be carried out on the basis of the individual physical requirements of each student.</p>





<h2 id="3">3. Types of Hands-On Yoga Assists</h2>



<p>Basically, there are two types of yoga adjustments: good and bad adjustments. Jokes apart. In general, we can distinguish between static and dynamic adjustments. Static adjustments can be further divided into passive, active, and prana adjustments. Let’s look at these different categories in more detail.</p>



<h2>3.1. Static adjustments</h2>



<h3>3.1.1. Active Adjustments</h3>



<p>Active adjustments mean that the teacher provides tactile stimuli as an impulse to the student to activate their muscles in a particular way. <strong>The student’s muscles react to the teacher’s physical contact</strong> and, as a result, they are able to align their body in an anatomically correct way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This method enables students to learn how their body works and how to perform the pose correctly next time. They learn what is important and what they need to do in a particular pose. This <strong>trains their body intelligence</strong> and they have a high learning curve.</p>

</div>



<h3>3.1.2. Passive Adjustments</h3>



<p>This is the more conventional way of adjusting and can be very beneficial for students when the yoga teacher has <strong>sound knowledge of anatomy</strong>.</p>



<p>The <strong>teacher applies an action on the student’s body</strong>, which reacts to this stimulus and aligns itself correctly.&nbsp;The force exerted on the student’s body should always work to counteract compression in a particular area of the body. In most of these techniques, the teacher’s body weight is the source of this force.</p>



<p>Since this technique involves the manipulation of joints and muscles, there’s a <strong>high risk of injuries </strong>if the adjustment is not done mindfully. Therefore, passive hands-on assists should be carried out with care. </p>



<p>Since the teacher’s action or force brings the student into the correct position and/or into a deeper and more intense version of the asana, <strong>the student doesn’t actively contribute </strong>but rather stays passive. Consequently, the learning curve is not as high as in the case of an active adjustment.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>3.1.3. Prana Adjustments</h3>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prana</a> is the life force that flows with the breath. Prana adjustment means <strong>adjusting the internal alignment</strong> of the breath to correct the physical position of the body from the inside out.</p>



<p>The intention is to shift the pressure within the body by activating the diaphragm and <em>transversus abdominis </em>in order to<strong> counter compression</strong> in the joints and, ultimately, to ease pain. To create more space, the teacher can use tactile stimuli on certain parts of the body that may otherwise be compressed in the asana.</p>



<p>This makes prana adjustment <strong>a simple yet very effective way of adjusting the body</strong>. Furthermore, it helps to calm the mind and to bring the student back into the present moment.</p>



<p>In general, as a yoga teacher, you position yourself beside the student and place one hand on that area of the student’s body that needs to be adjusted. You then instruct the student to “<em>breathe into this part of the body</em>”.</p>

</div>



<h2>3.2. Dynamic adjustments</h2>



<p>Dynamic adjustments especially play a role in yoga styles with a lot of movement and changes in direction such as Vinyasa or <a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/inside-flow-yoga-teaches-us-a-lot-about-grace">Inside Flow</a>. Here, your task as a yoga teacher is to support and correct your students <strong>during the transitions</strong> between the asanas of the sequence.</p>



<p>This means that you use touch to <strong>give your students a direction</strong> of movement and the navigation toward the next movement. Since you (should!) know which pose is coming next, you can start moving toward your adjustment a bit earlier than your student.</p>



<p>In a certain manner, a Vinyasa adjustment also is a form of Vinyasa flow. This means that you want to move just as steadily and smoothly as your students. Do not change your speed – neither between the adjustments nor during an adjustment. You don’t want to disturb the student’s flow but support it in the best possible way. Imagine you want to <strong>adjust like an ‘invisible angel’</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>You can also</strong> take more time in individual transitions in order to adjust and explain more. Sometimes it is enough to only adjust one movement but hold the pose longer. In that case, inform your students early enough that they will need to stop in that pose.</p>



<p>You can also use the time between two songs to hold a pose longer and explain and/or adjust more in that particular pose.</p>



<p>And while you should be able to adjust every asana of your Vinyasa sequence, you don’t need to. Rather focus on providing hands-on assists <strong>in the key asanas</strong>, such as jumps, handstand, etc. In general, you don’t need to adjust simpler poses such as <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/tadasana-mountain-yoga-pose/">Mountain pose</a>, Mini Warrior, Mini Wild Thing, etc.</p>



<p>You should also always make sure that you use solid touch and <strong>avoid unnecessary steps and movements </strong>on your part. Otherwise, you will disturb your students’ flow and they will get unsteady and nervous. If you feel uncertain and get nervous during adjustments, your students will also get nervous and will feel unsafe.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Remember:</strong> It’s all about what kind of energy you transmit to your students. They will pick up that same energy and embody it.&nbsp;</p>





<h2>4. Conclusion On Yoga Adjustments: To Touch or Not to Touch?</h2>



<p>The answer to the question of <strong>whether or not to provide hands-on yoga assists</strong> is just as individual as yoga itself. Everybody and every body is different. So, what works for one person or one body might not be appropriate for another. </p>



<p>For some students, hands-on adjustments from an experienced teacher are a great way for their body to understand proper alignment. Other students simply don’t want to be touched at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep in mind that providing hands-on assists <strong>does not necessarily make your yoga class better by itself.</strong> As a skilled yoga teacher, you should know how to instruct your students in the safest, healthiest, and most efficient manner – with or without touching them.</p>



<p>Never forget that <strong>touching people is a privilege</strong>. This means that, as soon as you come close to, and touch a yoga student in your role as a yoga teacher, you inevitably invade their personal space. The moment you enter this space, the situation automatically feels very intimate – for some students even like an invasion of privacy.</p>



<p>Therefore, yoga teachers need to <strong>be particularly sensitive</strong> when it comes to touching their students. Even if a hands-on assist is anatomically correct, it can feel emotionally incorrect. This means that you risk harming your student and abusing your power as a yoga teacher.</p>



<p>That being said, a yoga teacher who is able to provide intelligent and helpful hands-on adjustments can <strong>connect with their students on a much deeper level.</strong></p>



<p>Maybe the most important thing to remember is that learning to physically adjust students in a safe, healthy, and efficient way takes <strong>time and practice</strong>. Even the most experienced yoga teachers (like our <a href="https://tintyoga.com/instructors/">TINT Instructors</a>) started by giving small hands-on assists to their students and gradually worked up to more complex adjustment methods. </p>



<p>With <strong>patience, persistence, and regular practice</strong>, you will be able to gain more confidence in adjusting your students and increase your adjustment skills over time.</p>



<p>And since we want to support you on this journey as <strong>your true partner and coach</strong>, we created a number of <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/pages/live">live classes</a> with some of our highly skilled TINT Instructors that focus on different aspects of alignment.</p>

<h1 id="1">1. Introduction – What Is TINT?</h1>



<p>TINT Yoga is an online education and coaching platform for ambitious yogis, yoga lovers, and yoga teachers. However, we are not a usual yoga platform. We question traditional yoga. We embrace evolution and have the courage to be different. We want to lead by positive example and encourage you to do the same.</p>



<p>Read on to find out more about our vision, mission and offers. But let’s start with some basic facts about TINT.</p>



<h2>1.1. Bringing Meaning Into Our Logo&nbsp;</h2>



<h3>The Acronym TINT</h3>



<p>Our logo is composed of two elements: first TINT, the name of the company. This acronym stands for “There is no try”. This is an attitude related to doing things with passion, awareness and without excuse or exception. Don’t just <em>try</em>. <em>Do</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not a secret that we only live once. But have you ever really thought about what this means? Everything you do has an impact. And every second of your life, you have the opportunity to have an impact. Do or do not. There is no in between. Always do what’s in your power and put all your heart into it. Don’t let limits hold you back. Don’t overthink, take action instead. Don’t let the world hold you back. Trust in yourself and do. That’s the reason why we don’t offer a free trial. We encourage you to go all in and commit wholeheartedly to your personal growth.</p>



<h3>The Gömböc</h3>



<p>The second element is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6mb%C3%B6c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gömböc</a>. This is a convex three-dimensional homogeneous body that, when resting on a flat surface, has just one stable and one unstable point of equilibrium. As such, it is a symbol for stability and balance. It is an object that can return to an equilibrium point regardless of the position in which it is placed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider this a metaphor for your own behavior: Don’t let the circumstances around you throw you out of balance. When you know your purpose, your values, and your goals, you will always find your true north and stay on the straight and narrow.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>1.2. Our 4 Pillars: Knowledge, Personality, Inspiration, Success</h2>



<p>We want to be more than just an online yoga provider for you. We give you the tools you need to find happiness and fulfillment. We base our offerings on these 4 pillars:&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Knowledge&nbsp;</h3>



<p>All our contents are based on the most recent findings in anatomy and physiology and are presented by highly skilled instructors with many years of experience. Most of them are pioneers in their special field and have already inspired thousands of students and aspiring yoga teachers.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Personality&nbsp;</h3>



<p>We provide you with all the tools and knowledge you need to grow not only your physical strength but also to work on your mental strengths to become the person you want to be.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Inspiration&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Get inspired by valuable input from our instructors, who can draw upon their many years of experience as teachers of teachers.</p>



<h3>Success</h3>



<p>We help you find and execute the right strategy to live the life you’ve always dreamed of. Maybe you want to bring more awareness into your life or take your yoga practice to the next level. Maybe you want to work on your mental strength. Or you even aspire to become a yoga teacher yourself. No matter what it is, we want to give you the tools you need to fulfill your dreams.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="2">2. Our Vision – Why We Founded TINT</h2>



<p>We are passionate about helping people to achieve personal fulfillment to find happiness. We truly believe that we are responsible for our happiness and can take action to induce change. Yoga is a great tool to achieve fulfillment as it deeply connects body and mind in a way no other movement form does.</p>



<p>More than 200 million people practice yoga worldwide – and due to recent global developments, online yoga has gained increasing public awareness and is practiced more and more frequently.</p>



<p>This is predominantly a good thing as it makes yoga accessible to people who do not have an (affordable) yoga studio close to them or cannot find their favorite style of yoga or yoga teacher nearby.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, yoga is more than just a trend and a good stretch. When practiced correctly, it is a great tool to work on your mobility, flexibility, and stability. It also helps you to improve your body awareness and body intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, yoga is also a mental practice, helping you to develop a healthier mindset, train your resilience, and practice mindfulness, which will organically translate into your life off the mat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like no other movement form, yoga is a holistic body-and-mind practice that has many benefits for your physical and mental health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if practiced incorrectly – maybe due to an insufficiently trained teacher – you can also harm your body. Especially inexperienced yoga practitioners tend to overestimate the limits of their bodies (or haven’t detected them yet!) and push themselves harder into poses than would do them good. And all that because they received inadequate guidance from an (online) yoga teacher or because they tried to equal the oh so gorgeous yoga teachers on Social Media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the vast offer of online yoga classes, it’s difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff, i.e. to find high-quality content that is healthy, safe, and efficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where TINT comes into play: It is our passion to support people to find personal fulfillment and success. This is only possible with a strong commitment. And that’s what our brand name stands for: TINT – there is no try.</p>



<p>Furthermore, we partner with highly skilled professionals with years of experience as yoga teachers and teachers of teachers in order to ensure a safe and efficient online yoga practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We want to support you on your journey to personal fulfillment and success. We see ourselves as a true partner and coach. We are more than just an online yoga platform with on-demand yoga video content. We want you to grow, develop, and achieve your goals. Our offers are aimed at ambitious yoga lovers and yoga teachers, who are willing to face change and growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, we are not for beginners. We are for ambitious yoga lovers and yoga teachers who live these values to the fullest.</p>



<p></p>



<h1 id="3">3. Our Mission – How We Want to Support You</h1>



<div class="quote-wrapper">
<p class="quote">&#8220;We enable ambitious yoga lovers to achieve personal fulfillment and success no matter where you are. We act as a true partner and coach on your journey to sustainable growth while creating lasting memories along your way. We don’t try. We stand out. We do. There is no try.&#8221;</p>
<p class="quote-author">– TINT.</p>
</div>



<p>We are more than just a content provider. We help and support you by giving you the tools you need. We deliver knowledge, inspiration, and feedback. We make things possible.</p>



<h2>3.1. For Ambitious Yoga Lovers</h2>



<p>In contrast to other online yoga providers, we focus on committed yoga practitioners who want to evolve and thrive and are constantly seeking to improve their knowledge and skills. If you want to live your passion for yoga and are convinced that yoga is a powerful tool to better understand the body and mind, you’ve come to the right place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, this means that we are not for beginners. On the one hand, because beginners are in the safest possible hands in an in-person class with an experienced yoga teacher who can actually touch and adjust them adequately.</p>



<p>On the other hand, we believe that at least some basic knowledge and experience is required in order to move further. You need a solid foundation to build your dream house. The same goes for yoga (or any other practice).</p>



<h2>3.2. Achieve Personal Fulfillment and Success</h2>



<p>TINT is the place to live your passion: If your purpose of life is to bring joy and happiness to others, then yoga is a great vehicle to achieve this. Like no other movement practice, yoga combines physical and mental practices, making it a holistic approach to a healthier body and mind.</p>



<p>Apart from that, if you are or want to become a yoga teacher, this practice is a great way to have an impact on other people’s lives and receive recognition by supporting others to thrive. You will feel valued, receive appreciation and appreciate yourself on a deeper level. Yoga can help you become the person you want to be and we want to support you with this as best as we can.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you’ve always dreamed of earning a living with yoga, we help you find and execute the right strategy to achieve exactly this. We provide you the tools and knowledge, and boost your self-esteem and courage so that you can stand out and live to your full potential.</p>



<h2>3.3. Your True Partner and Coach – Wherever You Are</h2>



<p>We want to be more for you than just an online yoga platform. We believe in mutual long-term commitment that is based on a relationship of trust. Our commitment towards you: We are there for you. We listen to your needs, fears, and doubts. We motivate and inspire you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your commitment towards us: Your whole heart, passion, and sincerity. That’s the reason why we don’t offer a free trial period (remember: There is no try.). We don’t want to entice you with seductive promotion offers or huge no-brainer discounts. We want you to make a conscious decision to invest energy, time and – yes – also money in yourself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But don’t worry: Should you find out that TINT really isn’t for you (what we don’t hope but – hey – you can’t be everybody’s darling), we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. You can simply send a message to our <a href="https://tintyoga.com/help">Support Team</a> (who, by the way, is always willing to help you with any other issues as well!) and we will refund the money. No questions asked. Promised. Just make sure it’s within the 30 days from your subscription date.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also believe in growth through honest and constructive feedback – on both sides. That’s why we have implemented a <a href="https://feedback.tintyoga.com/">Feedback Portal</a> where you can tell us what you need, what you don’t like, and what your pain points are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also want to make high-quality yoga content and education accessible to everybody and every body. We want to offer you an easily accessible and flexible learning and training experience where place and time no longer are a restriction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With TINT, you can enjoy exclusive yoga and inspirational content and connect with like-minded people – irrespective of your current personal living conditions. That makes online yoga such a powerful tool nowadays. And with our smartphone and smartTV apps, you can even access TINT on the go and download your favorite contents to use in times where you don’t have an internet connection.</p>



<h2>3.4. Your Journey to Sustainable Growth</h2>



<p>TINT is the place for people who are ready to face the challenges of a real journey towards success and fulfillment. Single events won’t make a change. The road to happiness is not straight. It’s a roller-coaster. We are at your side through all the ups and downs.</p>



<p>Sustainable growth means repeatable and healthy development that is responsible to, and for, current and future communities. It’s the key to long-term success, happiness and fulfilment.</p>



<p>We believe in healthy and lasting improvements and want to help you produce long-term effects. This is why our minimum membership is 3 months. It took, for example, 29 years until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a> invented the telephone and he filed more than <a href="https://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-alexander-graham-bell">600 lawsuits</a> over his telephone patent. Growth won’t happen overnight. With this minimum commitment, you lay the foundation for your long-term growth and development.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<h1 id="4">4. Our Offer – What We Do for You</h1>



<p>Our offer comprises two main products: our TINT Membership with new content every day, including single classes to practice, series to learn and increase your knowledge, and inspirational videos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second part is our TINT Academy with certified yoga teacher trainings, varying from full 200-hour yoga teacher trainings to Inside Flow teacher trainings and more.</p>



<p>Plus, our contents are easily accessible since you can watch them online via your browser, or use our smartphone and smartTV apps where you can even download your favorite content pieces and watch them without an Internet connection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The global yoga market is huge but we are committed to a clear vision and direction and, thus, found our niche. We are ready to revolutionize yoga training and education with a modern approach and a holistic content strategy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>4.3. Regular Livestreams – a New Focus Every Month</h2>



<p>Our regular weekly <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/pages/live">livestreams</a> are another important milestone on your way to sustainable growth and to achieve new goals. However, our livestreams are not just random online yoga practices. All our live classes have a specific focus that changes every month. This means, for an entire month, we will work on a particular topic together for an entire month to achieve one dedicated goal. This can be, for example, a teaching-related topic such as sequencing, or a more practice-oriented theme like our <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/programs/inside-flow-summer-challenge">Inside Flow Summer Challenge 2021</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="intro-text">Warrior 3 – or <em>Virabhadrasana 3</em> as it is called in Sanskrit – is a <strong>standing balance </strong>yoga pose and the third variation of the warrior series.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>These asanas are very commonly integrated into a yoga sequence and are also often underestimated in regard to their benefits to the body and mind. While <a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/warrior-1-yoga-position">Warrior 1</a> and <a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/warrior-2-yoga-pose">Warrior 2</a> tend to be yoga poses that <a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/teaching-yoga-to-beginners">beginners</a> can be introduced to, Warrior 3 is regarded to be for slightly more experienced yogis (<strong>intermediate level</strong>). </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>However, whether beginner, intermediate or advanced, this asana will <strong>stop yogis from overthinking inner struggles </strong>and get them back into their moving body. Why? It challenges yogis to consciously activate the strength of the legs’, arms’ and torso’s muscles, to focus, and to find physical and mental balance and steadiness.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Start in <strong>Warrior 1</strong>. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Place both hands onto the hip bones. The front leg is going to be the <strong>standing leg</strong>. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Lift your back heel to straighten the foot and further square the hips. <strong>Tuck your navel</strong> in and up. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Keep the standing leg bent while you start <strong>shifting your bodyweight </strong>slowly onto your front leg. Start activating your back muscles.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Place or pull the back foot a few centimeters forward. Your gaze (<em>Drishti</em>) is <strong>focussed on a non-moving point</strong> on the ground, about half a meter in front of your standing foot.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>6. Once you feel safe and well-balanced, inhale and <strong>lift the back leg</strong> by engaging your back thigh muscles and glutes. Your weight is evenly distributed on the four corners of your standing leg’s foot. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>7. Keep the <strong>pelvis straight</strong> like in Warrior 1, meaning parallel to the mat, and tilt your upper body forward, so that your chest is also parallel to the mat. If it is available to you, your back leg and your upper body are in line with each other. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>8. Flex the lifted back foot, toes point down, and engage the foot by actively pushing the heel away from you.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>9. Your <strong>standing leg remains micro-bent</strong> and engaged &#8211; you are allowed to be slightly shaky. Focus on the engagement of all necessary muscles and you will find more balance. Remember your <em>Drishti</em>. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>10. The crown of your head pulls away from your shoulders, <strong>elongating the neck and spine</strong>. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>11. If it is available to you and you feel in balance, then reach your arms towards the front of your mat. Keep them strong, your shoulders might lift slightly to move your ribcage forward and up to give your lungs more room to breathe.  Your palms face each other and your fingers are engaged. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>12. Remember to <strong>breathe consciously</strong> through your nose (ujjayi breath). Back foot and hands reach away from each other and stretch.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>13. To release the pose, exhale, bend the standing leg more and place your lifted foot back onto the ground.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>14. Inhale and engage your core to rise back up into Warrior 1. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h2 id="2">2. What Is Your Body Doing in Warrior 3 Yoga Pose?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is very important to know about the alignment of the body to always be safe and feel comfortable while practicing yoga. For everyone who enjoys learning more about alignment, we put together this easy-read ebook, free to download. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>2.1. Upper Body</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Let’s look at the <strong>upper body</strong> first: </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In <em>Virabhadrasana 3,</em> the <strong>spine is neutral</strong> due to the spinal flexors and extensors supporting to calibrate concentric and eccentric contractions. So the <strong>back muscles are strong</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Moreover, the <em>psoas minor </em>and the abdominal muscles contract to <strong>prevent the lumbar spine from hyperextending</strong>. To help with the abs, tuck the navel in and up.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The sternum is minimally lifted proudly, and the chest is open. The neck muscles contract as well to <strong>support the cervical spine</strong> carrying the head’s weight.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, the shoulders are abducted and, if the arms reach forward above the head, the <strong>arms are pronated</strong> and the triceps engaged. The muscles in hands and fingers are actively extended. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>2.2. Lower Body</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, let’s move on to the <strong>lower body</strong>: </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the <strong>standing leg</strong>, the quad muscles are engaged, the <em>articularis genu</em> and <em>vastii</em> flex to lift the patella of the knee. The glute muscles contract to support the abduction and flexion of the hip. The pelvis bones are parallel to the ground and slightly tilted up. All muscles of the foot support the integrity of the foot.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the <strong>back leg</strong>, the femur is internally rotated so that the knee and foot both point to the ground. Also here, the hamstrings, quads, and muscles around the knee contract to lift the leg and the patella. The foot muscles and calf are engaged to flex the foot. Imagine your heel pushes away from your calf. </p>

<h2 id="3">3. WhEre Did Virabhadrasana 3 (warrior 3) get its Name from?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine you are combating and defeating someone with your sword. Do you find this a not very yogi-like image for an asana due to its principle of non-violence (<em>ahimsa</em>)? Then find out about the mythological background of the <a href="https://jivamuktiyoga.com/fotm/warrior-poses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warrior poses</a> now and you will understand this image. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Virabhadrasana</em> originates from the name <strong>Virabhadra</strong> who, as it is said, was a <strong>warrior created by Shiva’s anger</strong> and despair. But let’s go back slightly in the story: Daksha, father of Sati who is the wife of Shiva, does not approve of Shiva as a son-in-law. So he excludes Shiva from family events, even shuns him to demonstrate his disdain. This upsets Sati to a degree that the fire burning inside of her grows until she bursts into flames. Now, Shiva, in his grief and anger, cuts off one of his dreadlocks, throws it on the floor &#8211; and then Virabhadra appears. Shiva tells him to <strong>storm the Daksha’s palace</strong>, Sati’s father and king, as revenge. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Here come the warrior asanas: So Virabhadra bows one knee and raises the arms up in service of Shiva who orders him to lead the army (<strong>Warrior 1</strong>). Then Virabhadra wields his sword and is ready for battle (<strong>Warrior 2</strong>) and to take the army to the palace. When they arrive, he finds Daksha and <strong>swings his sword to behead him</strong> (Warrior 3). </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When Shiva sees and realizes the damage his ordered army has done, he regrets the innocent lives lost. As a sign of letting go of his anger and replacing it with compassion, he replaces Daksha’s head with the head of a goat. Thereby, he resurrects Daksha who then bows to Shiva to show his respect towards him and Shiva’s deep love and loyalty to Sati (<strong>Humble Warrior</strong>). </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As is often the case with stories, there is a <strong>meaning</strong> behind it or a lesson to be learned: <em>Virabhadrasana</em> does not actually refer to fighting. Rather, it metaphorically reminds yogis <strong>to overcome the ego, the mind, and self-ignorance</strong>. It states: Be brave, stand firm, and take action in tough times, connecting to your heart’s whisper and inner strength. That way, Warrior 3 helps you to push through inner conflicts.</p>

<h2 id="4">4. How Do You Build Warrior 3 Into Your Yoga Sequence?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You might have been inspired already by the transitions that Barbra Noh and Sianna Sherman use in their practices mentioned above. When integrating it into the sequence, it is important to remember that Warrior 3 is an <strong>intermediate standing balance</strong>. We collected a few examples of <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/yoga-standing-poses/">standing asanas</a> that almost naturally let yogis ease into the strength of Virabhadrasana 3: </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Mountain pose (<em><a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/tadasana-mountain-yoga-pose/">Tadasana</a></em>)</li>
<li>Warrior 1 </li>
<li>Warrior 2 </li>
<li>High Lunge.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When <strong>teaching experienced yogis</strong>, you might enjoy transitioning from the following standing balances into Virabhadrasana 3. They offer to keep the leg off the ground at all times while the standing leg might start burning: </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Half-Moon pose (<em><a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/half-moon-yoga-pose/">Ardha Chandrasana</a></em>)  </li>
<li>Eagle pose (<em>Garudasana</em>) </li>
<li>Hand To Big Toe pose (<em>Utthita Hasta Padangusthasana</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Some of these asanas also make <strong>good follow-up poses </strong>when coming out of Warrior 3, like stepping back into High Lunge or coming back to Tadasana. Additionally, afterwards you might enjoy transitioning into: </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Chair pose (<em><a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/utkatasana-chair-pose">Utkatasana</a></em>)</li>
<li>Tree pose (<em><a href="https://magazine.tintyoga.com/tree-pose-vrksasana">Vrksasana</a></em>) </li>
<li>Standing Half-bound Lotus (<em>Ardha Baddha Padmottanasana</em>)</li>
<li>Figure 4 (<a href="https://www.pocketyoga.com/pose/figure_four#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eka Pada Utkatasana</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Always keep in mind the level your students are at and give options if it is a mixed class and you still like to offer challenges to body and mind. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="5">5. What Are Possible Warrior 3 Variations?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There are several options that help reaching Virabhadrasana 3 step by step. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Of course, you may <strong>stop lifting your leg</strong> at the degree that feels comfortable for you. You may even start by keeping the tips of your toes on the ground and leaning forward only slightly, remaining the torso and back leg in line. From practice to practice, you will be able to lean forward more and to lift the back leg further.</li>
<li>You may <strong>use a chair</strong> to gently hold onto to help you with the balance. Make sure you do not rest them on the chair but keep the arms engaged. </li>
<li>You may place your back <strong>foot against a wall</strong>. This will help you balance while you actively push your foot away from you into the wall, engaging your core and leg muscles. </li>
<li>If you notice that straightening your arms above your head causes you to lose balance, then you may either bring your <strong>hands to heart-center</strong> in Anjali Mudra, reach your arms sideways, or <strong>reach your arms backwards</strong> like the wings of an airplane, palms facing towards the ground. The latter option will help you open your chest and ease your shoulders and neck if you struggle with tightness or soreness in that area. </li>
<li>If it feels good with your neck and shoulders while your arms reach forward, you may also <strong>interlock your hands</strong> and point your index fingers (Kali Mudra).</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For an increasing feeling of security and stability in your standing balances, we put together the <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/yoga-balance-poses/">10 most helpful recommendations</a> on how to improve similar asanas. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="6">6. When To Avoid Virabhadrasana 3? </h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There are a few <strong>contraindications</strong> that, if they are known to the yogi, require to refrain from practicing Warrior 3 or to stay in the option of leaving the toes of the back foot on the ground and only slightly leaning forward: </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Chronic back, shoulder, hip or leg injury: If your body screams pain, don’t do it. This accounts for any asana.</li>
<li>Pregnancy: choose an easy option here, so the abdominals do not need to be engaged</li>
<li>High blood pressure: For some people, the rush of blood to the head may cause dizziness or similar uncomfortable bodily sensations. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="7">7. What Are the Benefits of Warrior 3 Pose?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Virabhadrasana 3 truly <strong>engages the whole body</strong>, resulting in several benefits on both a physical and an energetic level. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Regarding your physique, Warrior 3 <strong>benefits glutes and the hip stabilizers</strong> as well as the muscles in legs and feet, strengthening their deep tissue. Moreover, it <strong>empowers the core and back muscles</strong> that need to cooperate to support each other and become the powerhouse of your body. These muscles also help neutralize, <strong>align and elongate your spine</strong>. Overall, your <strong>stability</strong> as well as your ability to balance increase. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Another physical benefit of Virabhadrasana 3 is the <strong>active opening and stretching of the chest</strong> and shoulder muscles that, especially in today’s smartphone age of slumped upper backs, realign and thereby improve your overall <strong>healthy posture</strong>. This also widens the rib cage slightly, giving the lungs more room and thereby <strong>enhancing your lungs&#8217; capacity</strong>. Since Warrior 3 involves several muscles and requires a great amount of attention to alignment, the asana supports your <strong>full-body coordination</strong>. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>On an energetic level, Warrior 3 also benefits your inner <strong>emotional and energetic balance</strong>. It will calm you and help you <strong>clear your mind</strong>. The intensity of the pose requires and thereby fosters your <strong>ability to focus and concentrate</strong>. When holding the pose and breathing, your awareness of your own inner strength, your ability to move and balance, and your inner energy increases. Furthermore, due to the stability and rooting down of the standing leg,  <em>Virabhadrasana 3</em> has grounding effects. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Generally, standing asanas and standing balances help the body to <strong>ground and connect to the earth</strong>. For example, if you have been on a plane for several hours, your body will welcome some asanas of that kind to <strong>balance your Vata element</strong>. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, as you have learned about the amazing benefits of Warrior 3, why don’t you get moving and start with some <a href="https://watch.tintyoga.com/programs/warrior-poses?cid=1508738&amp;offset=454">Warrior Poses for Beginners</a> with TINT Instructor <a href="https://tintyoga.com/instructors/hie-kim">Hie Kim</a>.

<p class="intro-text">For most serious practitioners, yoga is a lifestyle choice that goes far beyond daily yoga practice. It forges such a strong connection between the body, mind, and spirit that often transfers into all other aspects of daily life. In fact, yoga originated with the primary intent of connecting physical health with mental balance and emotional tranquility.</p>



<p>Yoga seeks to encourage a lifestyle where harmony, gratitude, calmness, and positive thinking receive just as much focus as physical health. This set of priorities makes <strong>yoga an incredibly powerful form of holistic therapy</strong> all of its own.</p>



<p>You might even say that <strong>yoga is its own complete integrative health care system</strong> because it encourages the mind and body to work together for overall wellness. Breathwork, meditation, and physical poses are all combined with the entire being in mind.</p>



<p>The poses promote a <strong>deeper sense of connectedness</strong> and physical and mental alignment. The mindful stretching, calmness, and discipline enhance overall wellbeing while supporting a <a href="https://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/health/womens-health/count-yoga-38-ways-yoga-keeps-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">variety of physical processes within the body</a>, including adrenal activity and hormonal balance.</p>



<p>With that in mind, it only makes sense that yoga can be an excellent complementary therapy to <strong>Traditional Chinese Medicine</strong> <strong>(TCM)</strong>. Let’s take a look at how these two holistic approaches can be integrated for even greater benefit.</p>

<h2 id="1">1. Traditional Chinese Medicine and Yoga Go Hand in Hand</h2>



<p>When you look at the origins of <strong>Traditional Chinese Medicine and yoga</strong>, they appear to be two entirely different holistic therapies. After all, yoga originated in India around 3000 BC, while TCM has been practiced for more than 3,500 years in China.</p>



<p>However, it’s very likely that <strong>these two practices were influenced by one another</strong>. While each one originated in its own culture, they both follow the same basic principle that balance in the mind and body are at the core of optimal health and wellbeing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Practitioners are finding that integrating these two ancient traditions can bring even more effective results for their patients. <strong>Adding TCM into a regular yoga practice</strong> can help you become more aware of your body on a deeper level. This deeper connection between the mind and body can help you achieve balance and support both your mental and physical health.</p>





<h2 id="2">2. The Fundamentals of Traditional Chinese Medicine</h2>



<p>To understand how <strong>Traditional Chinese Medicine can amplify your yoga practice</strong>, it might be helpful to understand some of the fundamentals of TCM. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, energy known as Qi moves through twelve meridians, with each meridian representing a specific organ. These meridians also connect the internal organs to the skin.</p>



<p>When Qi flows through these meridians freely, it promotes balance and supports healthy organ and body function. On the other hand, when the Qi becomes stagnant, it results in illness and pain in the organ and areas associated with that specific meridian.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine <strong>uses a variety of practices</strong> like acupuncture, acupressure, cupping, massage, and herbal medicine to promote energy flow, balance, and optimal health. Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners also recommend a practice called Qigong to promote good Qi flow and optimal health and balance in the mind and body.</p>



<h2 id="3">3. How Yoga and Chinese Medicine Are Similar</h2>



<p>If you have been practicing yoga for a while, you’re probably already beginning to see the connection here. One of the key principles of yoga is promoting mental and physical health through <strong>the proper flow of energy in the body</strong>. Yoga utilizes restful postures that are held for several minutes, and they are often focused on body meridians, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through these poses, <strong>yoga stimulates the energy pathways</strong> associated with each meridian. Holding the poses for an extended time places focus on the connective tissues that hold the cells of the body in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you are healthy, these connective tissues are strong and flexible, but when you’re ill, they’re rigid and tight. By performing and holding the poses, we can dissipate stagnant energy in these connective tissues, which <strong>benefits overall health</strong>.</p>



<p>In TCM, <strong>the meridians are also associated with specific emotions</strong>, such as fear, anger, and excitement. Excessive emotions are thought to disturb the body’s balance. Chinese Medicine practitioners treat the organ and the emotions associated with the organ to balance the autonomic nervous system and promote energy flow.</p>



<p>In yoga, we still use our body and mind to <strong>promote balance and harmony</strong>. Breathing techniques are used to promote oxygen flow, blood flow, and to calm the body, mind, and emotions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the end of the day, both practices emphasize <strong>energy flow and a mind-body balance</strong> to promote overall mental and physical health – they simply use different methods to get there.&nbsp;</p>





<h2 id="4">4. Ways to Integrate Yoga and Chinese Medicine</h2>



<p>Here’s how you can <strong>integrate Traditional Chinese Medicine into your yoga practice</strong> for even better results.</p>



<h3>4.1. Meditation</h3>



<p>Yoga and Traditional Chinese Medicine both utilize <strong>meditation as a key approach</strong> for balancing emotions and calming the mind. If you find meditation difficult, yoga postures can help you relax while promoting energy flow in the spine and balance in the mind, which are key concepts in TCM.</p>



<p>Both practices are all about connecting the mind and body, and meditation is a great way to promote awareness. It also reduces stress to amplify the benefits of both traditions.</p>

<h3>4.2. Chinese Herbal Medicine</h3>



<p>Chinese Herbal Medicine is an excellent addition to any yoga practitioner’s wellness routine. The beauty of Chinese herbs is that they can <strong>easily be combined with other holistic approaches</strong> for enhanced results. They provide a safer, more natural way to treat a variety of ailments without pharmaceuticals.</p>



<p>In Traditional Chinese Medicine, herbs are often incorporated into a holistic treatment plan to help<strong> bring the body back into balance</strong> and nourish the organs for improved overall health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Practitioners at the <a href="https://www.yinovacenter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yinova Center in NYC</a> explained how Chinese fertility herbs are used to “bring the hormones back into balance and support the reproductive system.” <strong>Adaptogenic herbs </strong>are also recommended for those suffering from chronic stress.</p>



<p><strong>Acupuncturists</strong> often incorporate herbs into their treatment regimens for pain relief and reducing inflammation due to illness and injury. It’s easy to see how <strong>yoga and Chinese Herbal Medicine</strong> can complement and enhance each other for a variety of conditions, as well as general health and wellness.</p>



<h3>4.3. Prenatal Massage</h3>



<p>For moms-to-be, <strong>prenatal massage and yoga </strong>can work together to address common pregnancy complaints and reduce aches and pains. A woman’s body goes through dramatic hormonal and physical changes as her pregnancy progresses, and these two therapies are fantastic for reducing discomfort while nurturing the body through every stage of pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yoga and prenatal massage <a href="https://yogadigest.com/why-yoga-and-prenatal-massage-should-go-hand-in-hand-during-pregnancy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can work together</a> to keep the uterus and ligaments toned and healthy. This is crucial for preventing issues like preterm labor, incontinence, and uterine prolapse. These two therapies can be beneficial for sore muscles and joints, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other common pregnancy discomforts that respond well to prenatal massage and yoga are lower back pain, sciatica, headaches, and leg cramps. In fact, edema, nasal congestion, and even heartburn can show drastic improvement when these strategies are combined.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Women who practice yoga and receive regular prenatal massage throughout their pregnancies have fewer issues with insomnia because they are calmer and less stressed. And both techniques can be <strong>adapted to each stage of pregnancy</strong>, working together for maximum benefit from conception through labor, delivery, and recovery.</p>

<h3>4.4. Acupuncture</h3>



<p>Acupuncture is an ancient practice that offers a safe and effective way to <strong>address chronic pain </strong>and a host of other health issues. It can also reduce inflammation and increase flexibility, as well as <a href="https://www.pacificcollege.edu/news/blog/2015/04/17/how-does-acupuncture-fertility-work-increase-chance-conception-without-side-effects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">correct hormonal imbalances and fertility issues</a>.</p>



<p>Acupuncture is based on the theory that energy, called Qi, runs throughout the body in various pathways that connect one organ system to another. These pathways can become blocked due to chronic stress, illness, or injury. This blocked energy is the cause of pain and illness. <strong>Acupuncture unblocks Qi</strong>, allowing it to move freely once again.</p>



<p>The process of inserting acupuncture needles into the body at various acupuncture points also encourages the <strong>release of endorphins</strong>. Endorphins are known as the body’s natural pain killers. They are said to be as much as 10,000 times more effective for relieving pain than morphine.</p>



<p>Acupuncture is also said to <strong>reduce inflammation in muscles and joint</strong>s, increase blood flow, and boost the immune system. It can relax tight muscles and improve range of motion while reducing strain and weariness in the muscles. It’s a great way to complement the positive effects you are seeing in your yoga practice.</p>

<h3>4.5. Incorporating the Elements and Seasons of TCM into Your Yoga Practice</h3>



<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine places a strong emphasis on the <a href="https://tintyoga.com/magazine/5-elements-of-nature/">five elements</a>. They are used to describe patterns and cycles in relation to the seasons. The water element is associated with winter, wood with spring, earth with late summer, fire with summer, and metal with fall.</p>



<p>One way to <strong>integrate the five elements of TCM into your yoga practice </strong>is to utilize a sequence of poses that targets the current season. For example, TCM medicine associates spring with the wood element, as well as renewal and growth and the liver and gallbladder.</p>



<p>The liver and gallbladder are essential for emotional and physical detoxification. When the <strong>energy is out of balance</strong> in these areas, we tend to feel stressed, irritable, and restless. We might experience headaches, mood fluctuations, and digestive upset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although imbalances in the wood element can happen at any time, they tend to be more prominent in the spring due to the long stagnation of winter. Yoga is a wonderful way to overcome this stagnation and stimulate the liver and gallbladder. Twists, bends, and inversions are especially useful for this.</p>



<p>Here’s another example: In the summer, you tend to be hot, so you would want to do practices that are cooling. That means performing the poses more slowly and deliberately, utilizing standing poses for stability, and incorporating meditation to nourish and cool the mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another idea is to use postures that focus on the fire element when you’re feeling sluggish. You might want to do sun salutations to perk up the fire in your body and energize the mind.</p>

<h3>4.6. Cupping Therapy</h3>



<p>Cupping is a TCM therapy that utilizes <strong>glass cups to create suction </strong>and stimulate specific acupuncture points. It is useful for stimulating energy flow, improving circulation, relieving muscle tension, and releasing toxins. It is an ancient technique for promoting healing and recovery.</p>



<p>Cupping is especially useful for <strong>relieving back and neck pain</strong>. It is often used in conjunction with acupuncture, massage, and yoga to speed recovery from cold and flu, support digestion, ease allergy symptoms, improve skin health, and promote stress relief.</p>



<p><strong>Combining cupping with yoga</strong> can maximize your performance and results. For example, cupping pulls toxins to the surface and yoga promotes better blood flow so the lymph system can flush those toxins out. Both practices promote blood flow which brings healing nutrients to the area.</p>



<h2 id="5">5. Wrapping Things Up</h2>



<p>Modern society often assumes that modern medicine is better than <strong>holistic practices like Traditional Chinese Medicine and yoga</strong>. But the truth is, these holistic and integrative approaches can provide longer-lasting and further-reaching benefits in many cases.</p>



<p>This is especially true for <strong>people with chronic health conditions </strong>where behavior and lifestyle modifications can dramatically improve their quality of life. Chronic stress, insomnia, poor diet, and fitness are also key contributors to many chronic issues, from diabetes to arthritis.</p>



<p>It’s also important to note that <strong>lifestyle modifications</strong>, such as yoga and TCM, can slow or potentially reverse the symptoms of many chronic illnesses, such as cancer, heart disease, and even migraines.</p>



<p>But even more than that, in cases <strong>where conventional medicine can’t diagnose a problem</strong>, holistic therapies can be especially beneficial. That’s because these therapies seek to correct systemic imbalances, both mentally and physically. The result is improved overall health that goes far beyond the issues the individual was seeking treatment for to begin with.</p>



<p>In our society, popping a pill for every ailment or pain is common practice, but that often provides only temporary relief. <strong>Combining these holistic approaches</strong> offers a better solution for lasting change and improved mental and physical wellbeing.</p>
